Comment,1,h2v2q4x,,0,1624549803.0,"Well, if you pick evenly from across the groups, but the groups are uneven to begin with, you can end up with very unbalanced sides. For instance, and oversimplifying, if you pick the number 1 team from groups with only one very strong team and have them face the number 2 or 3 team from groups stacked with strong steams, you end up with most strong teams facing each other already in the round of 16. 

I think the root issue is that the groups are not comparable in difficulty because they're seeded on the basis of rankings that do not necessarily reflect the current strength of each team, as they take into account historical performance and friendly matches. In this case, there were also nominally strong teams that performed relatively poorly in seemingly easy groups, exacerbating the appearance of two very unbalanced sides of the group of 16.",2021-06-24 18:50:03

I don’t agree  with Netherlands ALWAYS being underrated as this is the first big tournament they’ve been to in 7 years. As a German I find that we are hyped up for us but since 2018 we know that nothing might happen. And as for the English, since you are American you are probably intaking English media and English opinions, because everyone knows it’s not „coming home“. And tbh I think Netherlands will make at least the semi finals as Denmark, Wales and Czech aren’t better then Netherlands. A lot of other top teams aren’t really that great at the moment Portugal, France, Spain etc. so I do think Netherlands can do really well but I don’t think their team is strong enough.

Now if Lloris got to the ball before Danilo then I'd say you can't blame him because he got the ball.  But how can it be acceptable that the keeper comes flying in late and literally punches an opponent in the head, pretty strongly and it be acceptable.  Danilo probably has a concussion.

Coronavirus,9,fewjjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/fewjjx/coronavirus/,8,1583623573.0,"Wondering peoples thoughts on how this is developing, do any of you think it will affect the games?

Personally I think it might, particularly because the games are being played across Europe. Airlines are increasingly facing issues due to it and as seen with Italy, large events like sports are being affected - all games in the Serie A are being played behind closed doors. Also I don’t know if any of you follow rugby but currently games for the 6 Nations that we’re supposed to be played in Italy have been postponed until further notice.

All of the final games for the tournament are also being played in the UK which is currently seeing exponential growth in the number of people infected to a point where it’s almost doubling daily.

Finally, the board that makes decisions on such stuff will, if it comes to it, have to make a decision on what to do and obviously this will have to be done probably a fair bit before the games are supposed to start - so my concern is that even if the virus is cleared up by June, the games might already have been cancelled through caution before that.

I so hope something sorts this mess out. Also condolences to anyone actually affected by the virus.",2020-03-08 01:26:13

I bought **one ticket** in August 2019 for the **quarter-final 4 game in Rome** and now, because probably i can't attend the match, i'm looking for someone who want's to buy it.  
My first idea was to sell it in the Euro2020 official platform for resale tickets but i've read today that i should have put the tickets to resale until the late days of February. Is it a fact and i can't use that platform now for that effect?  
If i can't use the platform, my idea is try to sell the ticket online or use other non-official platforms like StubHub or Viagogo. Are they safe and trustable for the seller and the buyer or do you have other recommendations?  
If anyone who read this post have the real intention to buy the ticket, send me a message.

You’re doing the same, afterall.

The difference between me and you is: I don’t hide what I state under a false layer of virtues.
That’s typical from a snowflake, so it totally fits your clownish nature.

As for the “krauts” (or spaghetti, for Italians; or baguettes for French; and so on..), if one feels so offended by a joke which has zero consequences at all in real world, that’s again his problem, not mine.
He/She should grow up a bit, and keep the energy to mind more serious problems.

And by the way, there’s nothing wrong with a certain amount of nationalism, as long as it doesn’t produce violence and real suffering to other human beings.
Afterall, nationalism is the intrinsic reason behind competitions among NATIONAL teams. Otherwise we would just have clubs competing each others, and call it a day.

No, why would there be? Heterosexuality is the norm. 95% of kids grow up with it, statistically speaking. 

>If you feel that being gay/queer or showing gays/queers (in media or anywhere else) is a bad influence to your kids you are homophobic.

Or, you simply don't want your kids to be subjected to political/social/sexual ideology from a young and vulnerable age. The effects of this are well documented.

Like heterosexuality. Are there laws about showing heterosexual relationships in media?

If you feel that being gay/queer or showing gays/queers (in media or anywhere else) is a bad influence to your kids you are homophobic.

And if you make laws about displaying people in media that treat queers/gays worse than heterosexuals you have to get called out for that. Because this is pure systemic discrimination.

Just look at the hungarian goals it was all teamwork, beautiful passing. And what was the german or french goal... a lucky bounc from the defender and thats it.


The big nations worth 10 times more than the hungarian team and where was this difference? Nowhere. 10 minutes before the group stage ended looked like hungary will advance to the top 16.


And the fact that germany were happy because they could get a draw against hungary on home field says it all about the difference in mentality.

Comment,2,h2z4bv7,,0,1624638894.0,"**First things first: No, I'm not Danish.**  
  
**Croatia-Spain**: Despite Spain's emphatic win against Slovakia, they have been quite underwhelming this tournament. If Sweden and Poland can manage draws against Spain, so can Croatia. Croatia showed they were solid on penalties during the 2018 World Cup, so I think they'll reign supreme.  
  
**Netherlands-Denmark**: This might seem like a great upset, but if you look at Denmark's squad, player by player, you quickly see the immense quality they possess. Not to mention their excellent manager. They're genuinely one of the best teams in Europe (As in top 4-8). According to Elo ratings (much more accurate than FIFA World rankings), the Netherlands are just ranked two places higher. In other words, they're basically evenly matched, believe it or not. Denmark only obtained three points in the group stage, despite having home advantage in all matches, but the circumstances surrounding their loss to Finland were beyond extraordinary and shouldn't be overly considered when it comes to assessing their strength. Also, they played very well against Belgium and were unlucky to leave that match without any points. I think this match will go to penalties, where I give Denmark a slight edge. Schmeichel was heroic against Croatia at the 2018 World Cup, but still lost because his teammates failed to convert enough penalties. I think Denmark's greater recent experience combined with Schmeichel in the goal will grant Denmark a penalty shootout win. Also, let's not forget this is the Netherlands' first major tournament since the 2014 World Cup.  
  
**Germany-Denmark**: The same logic is applicable here. Germany were emphatic against Portugal, but their draw at home against Hungary indicates they are inconsistent. Not to mention their recent loss to North Macedonia and Mexico and South Korea. Germany were better than Denmark in a recent friendly between the two (it ended 1-1), but friendlies shouldn't be overly considered. Slovakia and England beat Germany ahead of Euro 2016, and Sweden beat Wales 3-0 etc. Löw has made Germany worryingly prone to unexpectedly losing matches and I think it will happen here too, even though Denmark is notably stronger than North Macedonia, South Korea and even Mexico.",2021-06-25 19:34:54

Gay people don't have a right to indoctrinate other people's children. Nobody is stripping their human rights by not allowing them to do this.

Comment,1,h2ymti9,,0,1624624800.0,"Look at the statistics. Hungary is not even playing football. The least thing of course they could do was playing like this in a group with France, Portugal and Germany.

And calling Germany games aweful for coming back 2 times against a full defence and time playing team, just shows how lost you are. 

Of course germany played at some points not well and there are a lot of things to improve, but there is a big difference in making the game or just sit back and want to destroy the game flow. 

So totally deserved to go through for germany. And we saw how germany can play against a team who want the ball on their own (Portugal) and the 2 defensive counterattack teams.

So go cry somewhere else or just don't watch it.

First of all, the Hungarian national team didn't do anything. They're not in charge of the country or even the team itself. They're just players. 

What you seem to be referring to is the decision taken by the Hungarian parliament (in a democratic vote) regarding LGBT education. The particular law in question prohibits LGBT activists from using children's TV shows/programs to push their agenda, which is a completely reasonable course of action to take. Children shouldn't be subjected to political or sexual teachings from a young age as it creates an environment that breeds indoctrination. This is what's already happening around the world where many LGBT groups have pushed their message onto children.

Not actually true. If you make a sliding tackle that is dangerous, even if you hit the ball, it can be a foul.

Example: a sliding tackle with spikes first.

Another example: sliding tackle with both feet

Reckless or careless tackles is the literal definition of fouls and cards.

Both french newspapers and experts support this decision and the question isn’t if it was or not a foul, but if a yellow card was enough. (I think yes)

Of course you can disagree, but legally it **makes** it a foul.

Of course a random different opinion is ok.

But it **was** a penalty.",2021-06-25 11:12:16

Even if you say the 50 50 ball was over as soon as it touched Pereira’s head the keep still has the right to block the shot. You can watch the replay yourself. He doesn’t swing nor intential punch his head. It’s his for arm that actually makes contact and it’s the risk ascoated with two people running head on. Much the reason why American football is trying to do away with kick returns and punts. They offer the opportunity for more severe injury. That still wasn’t a penalty as Lloris touched the ball *before* making contact with his head. Had it been the other way around then it would be a penalty but because he touched it, it’s nots reckless. It was a play on the ball which resulted in a hurt player. Just as sliding can look nasty but if you get ball from the front it’s legal. Doesn’t mean it can’t result in an injury doing it legally, but an injury doesn’t make it a foul.",2021-06-25 07:11:39

Would absolutely love an Italy - Netherlands final. Honestly, France might be the favorites, but something just doesn't click for me.

Comment,2,h2wpxnr,,0,1624585287.0,"I don't think people are under-rating the Dutch too much, a couple of summers back there was a lot of positivity around the Dutch. Ajax had made the CL semi finals with impressive performances with a side full of young Dutch talent, they had a manager in Koeman that had guided them comfortably to the Euros and the Nations League final (no tournament since 2014 so not a given) and in defence they have arguably the world's best centre half. 

Coming into the tournament, whilst the talent was still there they were missing van de Beek and van Dijk and Koeman was now at Barcelona. Frank De Boer's start as manager was less than impressive and I think the optimism and positivity surrounding them was far more subdued.  

From my own personal perspective (as an Englishman), one half of the draw (on paper anyway) is just far more favourable than the other. Nothing is guaranteed but if we're going to make the final I'd fancy our chances vs Germany at home, against one of Ukraine or Sweden in Rome and then in all likelihood vs Netherlands at home than having to overcome Spain and France on neutral ground and then one of Belgium, Portugal or Italy at home. 

For what it's worth I think we're likely to be eliminated by Germany, but I won't stop hoping and believing we can get through until we can't. As a nation of football fans we're absolutely desperate for some tournament success, we get carried away as and when it looks like there might be a small (however small) chance of it happening.",2021-06-25 04:41:27

Comment,3,h2wjkuy,,0,1624582516.0,"Interesting you say that. When the Germany/Hungary result was confirmed as 2-2 (just as the France/Portugal game entered stoppage time) the commentator made it known that the Portuguese manager knew his side were through regardless of result. I know there was only 4 or 5 minutes but I'm surprised Portugal didn't make more of an effort to try and win in stoppage time - a loss of one or two goals for Portugal would have made no difference to their position, they were in third anyway and playing Belgium. Had they managed to win last night they'd have been playing Switzerland instead. I was surprised they were happy to play out the draw at that stage.",2021-06-25 03:55:16

-Belgium won against an extremely good performance from Denmark. Although, they had some difficulties.

Both teams have shown excellent and disappointing things. The game could go either way. Portugal has a very strong attack and middlefield just like Belgium. However both team have shown critical flaws in their defense. I think there will be a lot of goals on both sides.",2021-06-25 01:48:47

They're always though teams to face of course but from what they've shown so far I honestly wouldn't be that scared and can see anyone taking a game of them in a setting like this where details and luck often decide.",2021-06-24 21:37:19

Maybe people don’t look at us because we weren’t there the last 7 years but we still had a good team but just bad coaches(Blind, old Hiddink) and a fair goal was called offside otherwise we would have been at the tournament. 

We also made it to the Nations League final(not saying that’s a world cup but just saying we dont suck because we beat France, Germany and England)

But still, we are the Dutch, we can beat the best but we are never(since 88) the best. 
Most times we are there for entertaining crazy games with a attacking playstyle and most times we kick out at least 1 good/favorite and then the road will end for us without a price.
We are a small country but top countries never like to meet us because we are not a easy win.

We can beat the English and German squad and they can beat us, if they say it’s a easy win they don’t have respect or knowledge.

Why are you so hateful? You are the one behaving like a little kid. 
Nobody agrees with me because you all are against France. You obviously lack of maturity, you can't even take a step back because you support the other team. That's also showing a lack of intelligence sadly.
I support France but I didn't contest for the foul on Coman, there should have been penalty too, but the VAR was not used. I didn't contest when Hummels tackled Mbappe, no VAR either.

If you are certain you cannot attend in 2021, you can request a refund now by clicking on the link below:

Yes. After the new match schedule for the tournament in 2021 is confirmed, should you be unable to attend the postponed tournament, you will have another opportunity to return your tickets and receive a full refund of the ticket price.

**What will happen with the souvenir tickets I had ordered?**

I wish a rule would be added that if you roll around on the ground in pain (fake or not) trying to get a call, if it exceeds a certain amount of time, you get pulled out of the game to not return. If a player is truly hurt, letting them play is no good for their health and safety should take precedence. If one isn't hurt, then get back up and play, and no faking allowed",2021-06-27 08:57:50

Comment,-1,h35e6l6,,0,1624773310.0,"As an Austrian first I thought ""Would be funny for Italy to win the Euro after winning Eurovision a month ago"". I didn't even have hope for our team but then I saw the game and still think they stole that first goal of us.

Looking back at the match I can say: Our team can play good it's just not passionate enough sometimes. The Italians played good and didn't have the need to play dirty like they did. Yes some may play dirtier but really... against us outsiders.

Over all we are one of the lucky ones who even did a goal. No. Two goals against Italy. An the team can return to Austria with some money for hopefully a new Ernst-Happel-Stadium so it's not too bad. After all we managed to get to the round of 16 and even as the outsider we assuredly earned it.

I just hope the team work more on their gameplay and stuff so that they can even be better and maybe achieve better results in the future. It's not the last Euro after all.

As for the Italians. They also played good, even as a... *so so* team. They are flexible, fast and athletic and have an utterly high passrate.

Comment,3,h35d14e,,0,1624772692.0,"If you want to pick apart performances as well, they can easily beat Portugal cause half of Portugal's goals have been penalties and just from Ronaldo, meaning they are overly reliant on one avenue to get goals. Italy on the other hand, regardless of where the goals are coming from, they also have the fact that their defence is super solid to fall back on. As long as you don't concede, the tournament is yours to lose, especially in this tournament. Sure the next match is gonna be a big challenge, but if they just play the way they've been playing, they can go far",2021-06-27 08:44:52

Comment,2,h35cjqs,,0,1624772428.0,"Meh. They look beatable by a better team imo.

Got a bit lucky for both goals. First one was great, but Laimer really let himself down trying to defend it. Second was just sloppy on Austria’s part.

Comment,6,h353zzw,,0,1624767984.0,"I'm Welsh. Well done Denmark!

However.....here is my rant.

This is the first time Denmark have had to leave coppenhagen this tournament. And it was to nearby Amsterdam. Wales have been to Baku and back via Rome. The referee was outrageous. Really harsh yellow for Wales, didn't call that blatant foul in the build up to the second goal, and one of the worst red cards I've ever seen in the closing moments.

Having said all that....we flat out struggled to ever get going, we deserved a 2 nil loss at least. the last 2 goals we'd sort of collapsed by then. Denmark looked really good, a proper side. Their two CBs, Christensen and Vestegard, were like a brick wall. It felt utterly hopeless everytime we attacked. If we thought Moore was gonna pull the strings as a big man up front holding up, we were sorely mistaken. I hope we got battered by eventual finalists! And they're still comparative underdogs in the tournament, and the whole eriksen story. They're a very likeable team. Good luck to them going forward.",2021-06-27 07:26:24

So what? An Ad Hominem fallacy at the Daily Mail?

The content is still valid. It isn’t even an opinion piece but a factual quotes of several football experts, such as Rio Ferdinand, Alan Shearer, Frank Lampard… (or other articles and opinions such as Stuarr Pearce, or [Pat Nevin](https://www.otbsports.com/soccer/lloris-punch-nevin-1215589))

In fact, experts discuss if it wouldn’t warrant a red card.

So:

-	Per the ref it was a foul
-	per the rules it was a foul
-	per experts it was a foul

To answer your other question, if Delta’s flights are comparable to KLM’s than they’ll have a loadfactor of about 50 to 70% what means there will be about 100 to 150 empty seats but it’s catching up quickly. A month ago we had flights departing with 280 out of 400 seats empty but now that number already dropped to 150 or lower and some flights between European destinations are already getting overbooked, and I think that will also be the case with flights within the US.",2021-06-26 23:54:09

Comment,3,h33ajg1,,0,1624728802.0,"No, unfortunately not. I've been checking back on the portal frequently over the past few days, more in hope than expectation. However I did think there would be a small chance - I believe the German FA didn't take their full allocation, there will be some tickets that weren't taken up by the UEFA family, some cancellations etc. So it always seemed probable that there would be small allocations at some point as we get closer to the fixture. 

There will, in probability, still be some unallocated tickets. Some are reserved for England travel supports club members (these are sold via the same portal), but there's a chance there are still UEFA tickets. 

It sucks that there wasn't any communication with people like yourself who held tickets before - it doesn't seem fair at all. All I can recommend is persistence. Keep this thread open, filter by new and also keep an eye on the england travel supporters club forum - so even if you aren't in the portal you may see a crucial update from a good samaritan.

I will keep my eyes open and report back on this thread if I hear anything, or if I see tickets come up again. I don't need to buy any more - but I will try to help anyone on here if I can.",2021-06-26 20:33:22

I can see them beating Portugal in a tough game (though I am Portuguese, so hoping not), but not Italy who to me me look to be so impressive and solid. 
Italy are the winners for me, with some small hope Portugal might upset things",2021-06-26 18:20:54

From the 16 qualified teams Italy, Netherlands, and Belgium had the best performance. The best player should be the one that helped them the most. From the Italian side I consider Immobile one of the top, since he's both scored and assisted for them. It's hard to mention KDB when he's participated only half the amount of time. Lukaku has delivered and Tibo has done great for the Belgians. On the Dutch side Wijnaldum should be the MVP right now, also Depay and Dumfries for their scoring and assisting points. Stekelenburg has saved properly as well.

Comment,1,h31qirc,,0,1624689914.0,">You're twisting the truth. The law forbids LGBTQ+ characters from appearing in children's shows period.

What exactly is an LGBT character? Sexual orientation or identity should not influence your appearance. There's no reason a gay person needs to dress in tight pink glitter clothing exposing his genitals. 

Eg, both of these people are gay: 


https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2F3%2F3e%2FDouglasMurray2019_crop.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDouglas_Murray_(author)&tbnid=S30G56U2Vu6_QM&vet=1&docid=eR-GwYMFdW4ItM&w=516&h=720&hl=en-AU&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim

https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.dw.com%2Fimage%2F49503635_303.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Fcologne-celebrates-germanys-largest-lgbt-pride-parade%2Fa-49500622&tbnid=AB0OwBQmEOwLFM&vet=1&docid=Ke-kLh7cmrQIqM&w=700&h=394&itg=1&hl=en-AU&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim

I'm.sure you can see how most of us would have no problem with one, but we would with the other. 

See, there's no ban on heterosexual people because heterosexual characters don't dress or present themselves in a way based purely around their sexuality. A heterosexual person can tell the news without distracting viewers and reminding them that he's heterosexual. 

If LGBT people can act in the same way, then nobody would have an issue. Like I said, sleep with whoever you want, live in whatever sexual identity you want, but keep it to yourself. Don't make it a part of your appearance to the point where it influences the way you speak, dress, walk, etc. If that's the message you want to send, then why should we be forced to listen? 

Your comparison to banning black characters is not accurate. Black people don't base their entire identity and message around being black. Sure, some of them do, and in this case it would be perfectly reasonable for the government to ban black people from appearing on TV in slanted jeans, smoking pot, and using the N word. It would also be acceptable to ban white people if they wore white supremecy tattoos. 

Again, the government is not checking people's sexual identity before they go on TV. An LGBT person can still go on TV and tell jokes, read the news, and do whatever else they want, as long as they don't do it in a way which brings attention to their sexuality. Who you decide to sleep in and how you express that desire is nobody's business.",2021-06-26 09:45:14

It's pretty straightforward, I sent an another email asking if the ticket number is checked by the airport authorities, my hypothesis is that in case they do ask then you might have to give it to them. Some modifications are needed, you can't just give the ticketing number. I'm not sure if the airport will ask or not, but there is a way to go around this, but I leave it up to you all to figure it out, as I don't want to be blamed for any wrong information in this regard",2021-05-28 02:33:18

Swiss FA supremo casts doubt on fate of 12-city UEFA Euro staging,6,kxro9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/kxro9b/swiss_fa_supremo_casts_doubt_on_fate_of_12city/,0,1610734067.0,"LONDON, January 15, 2020 - UEFA will decide in March on the shape of the rescheduled European Championship finals in June and July but the prospects of maintaining the original 12-venue extravaganza appear increasingly remote.

Dominique Blanc, president of the Swiss federation, has brought the issue out into the open by suggesting that the European federation should consider staging the finals in a tournament bubble in one single country  – such as Germany or Russia - or even a single city such as London.

Everything rests on how and when Europe’s nations may emerge from the latest second wave of Covid-19. Even then the likelihood of any fans attending will be in the balance.

The tournament, to be held in 12 cities, was originally scheduled to take place from June 12 to July 12, 2020. Last March UEFA postponed it for  year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The rearranged timespan is June 11 to July 11 this year.

Blanc told local media in Switzerland: “I believe that the Euro finals will be played but no-one can yet say how. We are not sure what could happen.

“In view of the health situation, I personally believe that the initial version, with competition spread throughout Europe, is unlikely to see the light of day, given the travel restrictions.

Distanced

“It seems to me, in any case, difficult. Right now I cannot imagine that Switzerland will be going to play in Baku as the draw states. ”

Blanc also assessed a return of spectators as “premature” this summer and proposed two alternatives for consideration.

He said:  “The first variant would be to play the Euro in a single country, in Russia or Germany for example. The second solution, even more restrictive, would be to resort to a single large city, with enough stadiums to house the six groups. This could be the case in London.”

UEFA has insisted all along that any opinions about the finals are personal and that no decision will be taken until the executive committee meets in early March.

Last November UEFA refuted media reports in Paris and Moscow that next summer’s rescheduled Euro 2020 finals would be staged in Russia.

UEFA president Aleksandr Ceferin has insisted: “For now we are planning exactly the same Euro as we have planned. […] So we don’t have any plan Bs for now. We will wait and we will see. We will monitor the situation.

“We are always concerned about the situation but we are absolutely sure that the Euro will be played. It has to be played; it can be played.

Ceferin’s options

“The only thing is that we don’t know if it will be with part of the spectators, full stadiums or no spectators. That depends on the health situation, but sport and football have to go on.

“For now, the plan is that we do it exactly as it is but I have to say that we could do a Euro, instead of in 12 countries, in 11, in eight, in five or in one country. So, we are still assessing the situation, we will see.”

The 12-country concept was developed and promoted by Frenchman Michel Platini during his term as president when UEFA was uncertain whether any country would bid to host the 2020 finals.

UEFA has been stuck ever since with a project whose air travel demands on teams and fans has come in for increasing criticism from ecological campaigners.

My Prediction for Euro 2020 Top 3,2,koe5br,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/koe5br/my_prediction_for_euro_2020_top_3/,8,1609547680.0,"So I just wanted to say that it's the Euro 2020 this year, in 2021, after being delayed due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Now it's January 1 I just wanted to say who I think will be in the Top 3.

&#x200B;

1. Croatia.
2. England.
3. France.

  
So I think Croatia has showed some strong form recently, especially in the 2018 World Cup where they were Runner's Up to France and beat England, who were also on form. Despite an Earthquake, The Pandemic and many more, before this Earthquake and Pandemic, way back in 2019, Croatia won Group E in the Qualifiers. One thing I am nervous about is if Croatia have lost form due to the Pandemic and Earthquake.

England will probably do well again, but here's a bold prediction I have, instead of being 4th like they were in the World Cup, I think they will be Top 3 material, again, the country suffered the worst of the Pandemic and I'm worried that as the players age and are locked down, they lose morale, the same case with Croatia and the Earthquake. I think England though could be in Top 3, provided players are on form.

As for France, I think France will be third, and possibly won't be able to repeat the success they had at the World Cup. 

&#x200B;

Again, I think world events deteriorate player form and morale. And this is why the results could play out very differently this year, the Cup may have to be held with no to barely any Spectators this year. However, I',m actually considering betting on Croatia, first of all, they have 25/1 odds, which means if they win and I bet £10 I get £250. England's odds pale in comparison at 9/2, which means they may be more likely to win but at less money.

Anyways, hope you've enjoyed my predictions. Even if most of them I predicted because of form and morale due to the pandemic.",2021-01-02 02:34:40

Finland 1-2 Russia  
Denmark 0-1 Belgium

Finland 1-0 Belgium\*

\*Belgium historically struggle against Finland for some reason. And Belgium are already guaranteed to win the group so they have nothing to play for.

Croatia 2-1 Czech Republic

\*Scotland has home advantage and Croatia are not a great away team. Scotland have also become famous for their ability to shithouse their way to wins. Additionally, Croatia struggles a lot with Scotland historically for some reason.

Comment,1,h3as59g,,0,1624895753.0,"Brother, just cause they played better today doesn't mean they're the better team overall. I have been talking about football all throughout the post when you Portugal lovers got hurt that I said the team is trash. They have talent sure, but they can't play as a team. Belgium played like a mature team and thats it. They've played the way youre alluding to many a time in the past but it never worked out for them cause they'd always end up losing and not going far, so they took a different approach this time and it worked. Why on earth would I call them scumbags based off one performance??? They are scumbags based off a decade of just slithering their through competitions without actually playing like a force of a team. 
Youre saying Belgium didn't play good today, but did Portugal play good this tournament? Or in the 2018 WC or in euro 2016?? Portugal is a trash team and im sorry you have to feel so strongly that you're losing sleep over trying to portray me as some butthurt fan",2021-06-28 18:55:53

Comment,1,h3amx88,,0,1624890965.0,"Well I was refering exactly to the semi-final 2018. What I find disappointing though, is that the Belgians played like this, when they've already shown that they are a team that could have easily gotten 3 goals yesterday, by being how they really are. Maybe they would have taken 1 or 2 goals from Portugal, but they would have hit back hard and won with their superior unity. Instead, they played into Portugal's nervousness and clumsiness and ended up almost contaminated by it. The mood and the vulgar fouls on both sides in the second half were such a sign of this. 

And with this, while certainly having one of the best and the most mature unity/technical/tactical balance in the EM, they showed a weakness. I don't know much about the Italian team this year, but Italians are usually good at exploiting weaknesses like this, by adding theatricality and killing you off when you fall for it. Then the Belgians better show off all their strength, instead of playing into the opponent's game.

Teams like Italy or France are still young and while Belgians are better in stats and generally on the field, these teams are still in a ""potential"" state. And we all know how hard they could hit if that potential was to show, even some spikes. I mean France is world champion and they still barely have shown 2/3 of their potential.",2021-06-28 17:36:05

Funny you mention this. (I am from Belgium) To this day I will argue that Belgium was the best team in the WC 2018. Undone in the semifinal by a defensive French team. And not getting the lucky bounce when it mattered.

Today's game v Portugal was a reverse of that. Portugal were the better team, but one brilliant strike from Thorgan Hazard, and then a little bit of luck saw Belgium through.

For sure the Red Devils will need to play better on Friday v Italy. But this is a veteran, talented and deep squad, so I am hopeful.",2021-06-28 15:02:57

Comment,4,h396g8z,,0,1624858875.0,"For me there’s physical play and there’s dirty play, I thought both teams were physical, I don’t think either of them were dirty. That Pepe play was absolutely disgusting though, was very lucky to only have gotten a yellow for that. I’ve seen people complain about the Palhinha challenge on de Bruyne, I just fail to see how that was dirty. Got the ball, but unfortunately also made contact, that’s the physical nature of the sport.

Ronaldo was a product of the formation today, we saw the difference once Felix and Andre Silva came in. Jota is AWFUL, worst player in our tournament. Ronaldo isn’t the creator he used to be, he needs to be fed, and he wasn’t being fed today. Had to constantly go out wide to try to spark something, but wasn’t working.

I’m rooting for Belgium now personally, I’d rather my team lose to the eventual champion, and it would be a cool story since Belgium has never won before. Italy will be a tough match, and they’re even more physical than Portugal. It will be difficult, but Belgium has the talent if the players are healthy. Good luck to you guys",2021-06-28 08:41:15

Sanches though. He's a beast and deserves more cold-headed teammates. That man is always everywhere and most of his actions made that game shine on the Portuguese side. 

Though the defensive play by Belgium was convincing, they were way too nervous handling that defensive play. All their superior tactical game (at least the passing) from the first half went down the drain as soon as Portugal showed some teeth.

Comment,2,h395e6o,,0,1624858336.0,"Disclaimer: I am from Belgium (now living in the US), so I might not be the most objective guy here. The only difference in this very tense match was the unstoppable strike from Torgen Hazard. 

That said, I was disappointed with Portugal's very rough play. How many times did they pile Eden Hazard into the ground? It felt like borderline intentionally trying to hurt his ankles. Pepe should've been red-carded for that one play long after the whistle. And where was Ronaldo? He didn't do squad today.

Looking at some of the comments in today's Match thread, not many, ok I didn't see a single comment, favoring Belgium over Italy. Obviously I am pulling for Belgium. The game today is a game they likely would have lost in 2016 (and in fact did, against Wales).

Comment,2,h38rcao,,0,1624851414.0,Idk I've enjoyed Taylor Twellman and Jon Champion on ESPN during the tournament so far. Not sure what you mean by obnoxious. He has been pretty reserved and Jon Champion handles most of the commentary with Twellman adding in analysis every so often or interesting facts that help give context to certain things.

And that we watch and celebrate this match together, recognizing, understanding both the troubled past of our history and ancestors, as we work together to make sure that today the same doesn’t happen, as well as providing the opportunities denied due to that same troubled past.

We are all work in progress, but today we celebrate together, because that is what football represents, to those that want it to.

Comment,4,h38fsq5,,0,1624845676.0,"Well without VAR he was getting away with a yellow. Those were little things you could do to prevent a goal that might not end up in a red if the ref doesn't see it but that's not the world anymore and VAR will catch them.

That plus it's a way to keep your team from conceding and hopefully being at 10 men is better than being a goal down. It worked for Suarez making the goal line save in the world cup against Ghana as the penalty got missed so Uruguay won.",2021-06-28 05:01:16

Comment,2,h37wibx,,0,1624836092.0,"Bookmakers use model for sure. Those model are most probable better than my algorithm. The odds bookmakers show are even more accurate, because they update it with actual betting and are therefore disclosing the knowledge of the general public.

Still I think it is nice to show these probabilities. For Example England and Portugal have almost the same rating, but England have more than double change of winning the tournament, since it is in the bottom half of the scheme and not in the top half with the better teams. This scheme makes these effects easily visible, since the human brain is not able to evaluate all 32768 scenario's.",2021-06-28 02:21:32

My guess is that if you were to compare your percentages with the percentages based on bookmaker odds, the bookmaker odds would have a higher degree of accuracy come the end of the tournament.

Most bookmakers use models too, but they often assigned arbitrary weight to variables based on their subjective analysis of the situation - which, perhaps counterintuitively, actually increases their accuracy.",2021-06-28 02:08:43

Comment,1,h37tunb,,0,1624834699.0,"I agree that especially national teams change a lot and play with large intervals (compared to club-teams).

I can image this can be improved using machine learning, for example an LSTM model. Any advice how to improve is welcome.

Kane and Foden are getting a lot of criticism but look what's behind them. They are not going to win the euros with Rice and Philips in midfield. Sideways passing all the time from Rice. He's soooo overrated!

I think the Germans will win simply because they'll have too much for England in midfield. Obviously this German team is not was good as it was 5 years ago but I still think Kroos, Gundogan and Goretzka will dominate the English midfield",2021-06-27 23:38:09

Comment,4,h3786v0,,0,1624820171.0,Don’t really understand this perception that all England fans expect the knockouts to be easy for us. We all know it’s going to be difficult and far from certain we can win any potential matchup. I feel like this perception of England is because of our horrible media who continue to overhype us and speculate who we might face in the final before we’ve even got out the round of 16 which is a 50/50 for us at best. The media is one of the biggest reasons why England falls short so much but it’s not something that can be changed easily.

>Border restrictions – England

If you enter the England from outside the UK or Ireland (or other parts of the Common Travel Area), you need to:

    Have a negative test in the three days (72 hours) prior to arrival.
    Complete a Passenger Locator Form. Border Force are currently checking all arrivals to ensure completion of the Passenger Locator Form and proof of required test bookings.
    Comply with other restrictions, depending on the country you are coming from (or have been in within the previous 10 days):

 

🔴 Entering from a Red List country:

British or Irish national or UK residents:

    Enter a managed quarantine hotel for 10 days at your own expense

 

Foreign Nationals without residence rights in the UK:

    Will be refused entry to the UK
    If it is suspected that an individual intends to do so, they may be denied entry on arrival at the border.

 

🟡 Entering from an Amber List country:

    Bring proof of a negative test result from within the last 72 hours (pre-departure test)
    Complete a Passenger Locator Form
    Quarantine at home or the place where you are staying (e.g. a hotel) for 10 days
    Take a COVID-19 test on or before day 2, and on or after day 8 at your own expense.
    Individuals will not be permitted to attend games that take place within the first 10 days of arriving in England, even if they hold a ticket. If it is suspected that an individual intends to do so, they may be denied entry on arrival at the border.
    Arrivals can end this isolation period on day 5 with a negative test result through the ‘test to release’ scheme - you could attend a match after that point. A negative test will still need to be booked for day 8.
    Individuals will be called by the Isolation Assurance and Compliance Service throughout their self-isolation period, to check that they are complying with their duty to self-isolate.

 

🟢 Entering from a Green list country:

    Bring proof of a negative test result from within the last 72 hours (pre-departure test)
    Complete a Passenger Locator Form
    Book and pay for in advance a day 2 COVID-19 test, to be taken after arrival",2021-06-02 20:47:05

* It doesn't work if three teams are tied in points
* The tiebreaker rules are accurate to a few degrees, but there's nothing in this sheet that let's you predict the amount of red/yellow cards.

Euro 2020 is just under a month away, and I checked out the Euro 2020 fantasy league game.

It only had a boring total points ranking, no head-to-head mode, no play off, no nothing = pretty much garbage.

So just like how I do it with Draft Fantasy Premier League where I manually create League Cups, FA Cup, Champions League, etc., I manually set up the Euro 2020 Fantasy League tournament (looking for 16 people), which will be using the official Euro 2020 Fantasy League as the source for scoring.

Please let me know if anyone wants to get in ($20 buy-in), the entire operation is taking place on my Discord server - please see below for the features and Discord invite link:

Discord: [https://discord.gg/St24HTapPd](https://discord.gg/St24HTapPd) (my user ID is the same, please find me there asap once youre on there's only a few spots left)

**1) Live Drawing for Euro 2020 Group Stage**

The date is TBD but I will be running a live drawing event on Discord for the 16 managers involved.

There's 4 seeded pots (seeds are based on 2020/2021 season draft Fantasy Premier League coefficient, if you're new to leagues and did not play FPL, no big deal, you will be placed in Pot 3 or 4) which the players will be drawn from.

**2) Euro 2020 Group Stage**

From #1 above, we get the groups below and your scores from the official Euro 2020 Fantasy League app/site will be used to play against other managers

"Important Updates on Euro 2020 Venue Changes, Capacities and Fan Info",8,mwueph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/mwueph/important_updates_on_euro_2020_venue_changes/,9,1619210631.0,"**Matches in Munich confirmed with a minimum of 14,500 spectators –**

**Seville replaces Bilbao – Dublin matches moved to Saint Petersburg and London.**

The UEFA Executive Committee met today via videoconference and was informed of the confirmation given by local authorities that all four UEFA EURO 2020 matches in Munich will be able to welcome a minimum of 14,500 spectators. Munich was therefore confirmed as a host venue for the championship.

**The committee then decided to reallocate some of the UEFA EURO 2020 matches as follows:**

* **The four matches initially scheduled to take place in Bilbao, will be moved to the Estadio La Cartuja in Seville.** The hosting of these matches is supported by the Autonomous Community of Andalusia, which has confirmed its intention of allowing spectators at 30% of the stadium capacity for the three Group E matches and a Round of 16 match. Following the decision of the local authorities, it was clear that fans were very unlikely to be able to attend the matches that were scheduled to be played there. Therefore, with the assistance of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), UEFA proposed to move those matches to another venue in that host country, simply to allow fans to attend the games after a year of not being able to watch live football in stadiums. This decision will allow a festive atmosphere at all matches taking place in UEFA’s flagship national team competition.
* **The three Group E matches initially scheduled for Dublin, will be reallocated to the Saint Petersburg Stadium**, which is already hosting three Group B matches and a quarter-final.
* **The Round of 16 match initially scheduled in Dublin, will be moved to Wembley Stadium in London.**

**UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin said:**

“We have been working diligently with the host associations and local authorities to ensure a safe and festive environment at the games and I am really pleased that we are able to welcome spectators at all matches for a celebration of national team football across the continent”.

&#x200B;

UEFA wishes to express its appreciation and gratitude to the cities of Bilbao and Dublin – both of which are considered as good venues to host future UEFA events – the national and regional governments of Spain and the Republic of Ireland, and all local stakeholders for their dedication, professionalism and efforts over the past years.

UEFA would also like to thank the Football Association of Ireland and its dedicated staff for their excellent collaboration and hard work, and is looking forward to continuing to work with the remaining eleven host associations in delivering UEFA EURO 2020 matches.

&#x200B;

**Information for Ticket Buyers**

All tickets for matches in Bilbao and Dublin will be cancelled. All impacted ticket buyers will receive a full refund for the face value of their cancelled tickets.

Further details about tickets sales for the re-organised matches in London, Saint Petersburg and Seville will be communicated on [EURO2020.com/tickets](https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/ticketing/#/) and via email to existing ticket buyers.

**Importantly, existing ticket buyers for Bilbao and Dublin will receive priority access on a first-come, first-served basis to future ticket sales windows for the corresponding re-organised fixtures.**

For any future ticket sales via Participating National Associations sales programmes, the rules of the respective fan clubs will apply.

&#x200B;

Fans are encouraged to carefully consider border entry restrictions and requirements and can find detailed information on the official spectator event guide, available on EURO2020.com and the UEFA EURO 2020 App, with additional information about COVID-19 mitigation measures at the stadium and travel information for each host city.

&#x200B;

**Follow My Team Ticket Buyers**

Considering the location for most knock-out matches is unknown until completion of the group-stage, and the existing significant travel restrictions, **UEFA has decided to cancel and refund all Follow My Team tickets.**

Importantly, the quota of Follow My Team tickets for the knockout stage matches will remain reserved for fans of the qualified teams, which will (subject to the rules of the respective fan clubs) still give them the opportunity to purchase tickets at a later stage, should their team progress and should travel restrictions permit them to reach the match venue at short notice.

&#x200B;

**So-called Super League** 

In addition, the UEFA Executive Committee was updated on the latest developments regarding the so-called ‘Super League’ including the options available to UEFA and the steps it is considering taking.

&#x200B;

**Note to Media:**

A Follow My Team ticket is a conditional ticket allowing fans to attend a knockout stage match of their team, independently of the location of the match. If the team is eliminated before that match, fans receive a reimbursement for the corresponding ticket after the tournament.

The post from Zbigniew Boniek’s official Twitter account came while he was attending a UEFA executive committee meeting that was deciding on changes to the 12-city hosting plan for Euro 2020.

Poland, Spain, Sweden and Slovakia were scheduled to play their Group E matches in Spain and Ireland. Bilbao and Dublin were selected as host cities in 2014 but their places have been at risk because authorities there could not give UEFA guarantees of welcoming enough fans into stadiums amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The three games in Bilbao have apparently been moved within Spain to Seville. St. Petersburg, which is already hosting four games in the tournament, is set to gain the three Group E games from Dublin.

Russia appears to be gaining more matches despite a Court of Arbitration for Sport ban on being selected to host world championships. UEFA, which is a European body, is not bound by December’s ruling at CAS.

Euro 2020 opens on June 11 after a one-year postponement because of the pandemic.

Bilbao told by UEFA it's been dropped as Euro 2020 host,5,mvtdmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/mvtdmx/bilbao_told_by_uefa_its_been_dropped_as_euro_2020/,6,1619080242.0,"MADRID — The Spanish city of Bilbao has been dropped by UEFA as a host for the upcoming European Championship, local authorities said Wednesday.

Bilbao was supposed to be one of 12 cities across the continent to host games for the tournament, but had been unable to give UEFA guarantees that fans would be allowed into the stadium amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The city's local organizers threatened to sue the European soccer body over its “unilateral” decision to drop Bilbao as a host. It had been scheduled to host Spain’s matches in Group E against Poland, Sweden and Slovakia. It would also host a round-of-16 match.

Organizers published a seven-point letter saying they wouldn’t allow anyone to “damage the image” of Bilbao, which had been preparing for the tournament for more than six years with “professionalism and responsibility.”

They said no one could question the capacity of the city and Basque Country to attract and organize the most varied types of events.


The Spanish soccer federation had said recently that the current pandemic situation in Bilbao made it impossible for fans to be allowed into matches based on the regulations established by health authorities in the northern Basque Country region, one of the hardest hit by the pandemic in Spain.

Other host cities for the June 11-July 11 tournament have given assurances to UEFA that spectators will be allowed into stadiums.

UEFA recently gave Rome, Munich, Bilbao and Dublin an extension to the deadline for providing guarantees on fans being allowed into games. The Italian government last week gave the all-clear for a limited number of fans at the city's venue, but Munich, Dublin and Bilbao still haven't offered guarantees.

UEFA' executive committee is expected to make its final decision on Friday.

The Spanish federation recently offered Seville as an alternative to Bilbao, with games to be played at the La Cartuja Stadium in the southern Andalusia region. The stadium was host to the Copa del Rey finals this month.

UEFA has used another stadium in Seville, Sevilla’s Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán, as a replacement venue after the home team was eliminated from the Champions League. It hosted both legs of the Chelsea-Porto quarterfinal because of travel restrictions between England and Portugal.

The games in Bilbao would have taken place at Athletic Bilbao's San Mamés Stadium.

Uefa set an initial deadline of April 7th for the original 12 host cities to provide minimum guarantees of capacity, as it plans for at least a limited number of supporters being in attendance at the games amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Nine of the cities have confirmed their plans but Dublin, along with Bilbao and Munich, have not.

And Varadkar told Today FM on Wednesday: “The last I heard was that the organisers (Uefa) were looking at us to commit to have at least 25 per cent of the stadium full.

“We’re cautious about that. We just think June is too soon. I think if they continue to insist on that, it will be hard for that to go ahead which is unfortunate.”

Uefa’s executive committee had initially been set to take a final decision on Euros hosting on Monday, but the decision of 12 of the continent’s top clubs to announce they had signed up to a breakaway Super League forced a delay until Friday.

The committee said on Monday it had tasked the Uefa administration with “drawing up concrete proposals” ahead of a final decision.

The Football Association said England stands ready to host additional games if asked, and it is understood Uefa would not limit itself to playing matches only at existing venues.

There have also been reports that Russia may take on extra matches.

"UEFA could ban Super League players from Euro 2020, World Cup",13,mu4roo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/mu4roo/uefa_could_ban_super_league_players_from_euro/,2,1618879459.0,"MONTREUX, Switzerland (AP) — Players at the 12 clubs setting up their own Super League could be banned from this year’s European Championship and next year’s World Cup, UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin said Monday.

Ceferin showed his sense of anger and betrayal by the leaders of some wealthy European clubs as he spoke of “snakes,” and wished UEFA could ban Super League clubs and players “as soon as possible” from all of its competitions.

Bieber sets K record, fans 13 as Indians beat Reds
Whether UEFA’s lawyers will advise that — with the Champions League and Europa League semifinals starting next week, and Euro 2020 kicking off in June — is unclear.


Ceferin spoke following a UEFA executive committee meeting and said some “legal assessments” will begin Tuesday morning. The meeting was held only hours after the English, Italian and Spanish clubs announced the Super League project that threatens to split the historic structure of European soccer.

“They will not be able to represent their national teams at any matches,” Ceferin earlier warned. “UEFA and the footballing world stand united against the disgraceful self-serving proposal we have seen in last 24 hours from a select few clubs in Europe that are fueled purely by greed above all else.”

UEFA’s 55 member federations are gathering for an annual meeting on Tuesday, including 24 nations that are playing in Euro 2020.

Three of the 12 rebels — Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid — are scheduled to play in the Champions League semifinals next week. Two more, Manchester United and Arsenal, are in the Europa League semifinals.

Earlier, the 12 planning to start the breakaway Super League told the leaders of FIFA and UEFA that they have begun legal action aimed at fending off threats to block the competition.

The letter was sent by the group to Ceferin and FIFA President Gianni Infantino saying the Super League has already been underwritten by funding of 4 billion euros ($5.5 billion) from American bank JPMorgan Chase.

Currently, teams have to qualify each year for the Champions League through their domestic leagues, but the Super League would lock in 15 places every season for the founding members. The seismic move to shake up the sport is partly engineered by the American owners of Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United, who also run franchises in closed U.S. leagues — a model they are trying to replicate in Europe.

UEFA warned the Super League clubs, including Barcelona and Juventus, that legal action would be taken against them and said they also would be barred from existing domestic competitions like the Spanish league and the Premier League.

“We are concerned that FIFA and UEFA may respond to this invitation letter by seeking to take punitive measures to exclude any participating club or player from their respective competitions,” the Super League clubs wrote to Infantino and Ceferin in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.

“Your formal statement does, however, compel us to take protective steps to secure ourselves against such an adverse reaction, which would not only jeopardize the funding commitment under the Grant but, significantly, would be unlawful. For this reason, SLCo (Super League Company) has filed a motion before the relevant courts in order to ensure the seamless establishment and operation of the Competition in accordance with applicable laws.”

The courts were not named.

“It is our duty, as SLCo’s board members, to ensure that all reasonable actions available to protect the interests of the Competition and our stakeholders are duly taken, given the irreparable damage that would be suffered if, for any reason, we were deprived of the opportunity to form promptly the Competition and distribute the proceeds of the Grant,” the Super League letter continued.

The Super League intends to launch a 20-team competition with 15 founding members but only 12 have currently signed up. The others are Liverpool and Tottenham from England, Atletico Madrid from Spain, and AC Milan and Inter Milan from Italy.

The breakaway was launched just as UEFA thought it had agreement on an expansion of the Champions League from 2024. Now, the same officials who backed the plans have decided to go it alone while claiming the existing competitions could remain — despite losing their most successful teams, including record 13-time European champion Real Madrid and six-time winner Liverpool.

UEFA approved the new format proposal Monday amid the turmoil.

The agreement was negotiated with the 246-member European Club Association. The ECA’s leader, Juventus president Andrea Agnelli, resigned from the UEFA executive committee overnight.

“He is probably biggest disappointment of all,” Ceferin said of Agnelli, whose young daughter he became godfather to. “I have never seen a person that would lie so many times and so persistently as he did.

“Now I know who is who. Who is honest. Who loves football.”

In their letter to the FIFA and UEFA presidents, the Super League clubs said their competition could also play alongside domestic leagues and cups.

“We do not seek to replace the UEFA’s Champions League or the Europa League,” they said, “but to compete with and exist alongside those tournaments.”

Special arrangements will be made for ticket buyers should a venue be changed or should a venue not be able to host any spectator and further details would be communicated in due course.

For tickets purchased through the Participating National Associations sales programme, the rules of the respective fan clubs will apply.

UEFA had set an April 7 deadline for venues to confirm minimum capacities, though London is yet to announce theirs and Dublin say they cannot commit to any number of fans.

&#x200B;

UEFA had set a deadline of April 7 for host nations to reveal minimum capacities to the governing body, with president Aleksander Ceferin previously saying that the tournament would not be played behind closed doors.

Despite a third wave of coronavirus spreading through mainland Europe, with the vaccine rollout looking to catch-up, Spain has confirmed that at least 25% of its Bilbao stadium will be open to spectators, amounting to approximately 13,000 fans.

&#x200B;

But that is only if checks are passed by the local health authority, and that infection rates are low with hospitals not overwhelmed. **The Scottish government have given approval to allow in up to 25 per cent capacity for the four Euros matches to be held at Hampden Park. The Dutch football association has said a minimum of 12,000 supporters will be permitted to watch fixtures at the Johan Cruyff Arena**, with the final number to be determined at a later stage by ministers in the Netherlands. 

&#x200B;

Rather than announcing that capacity may increase, **Romania’s sports ministry has said a maximum number of 13,000 will be able to attend matches in Bucharest**. **London is yet to reveal its plan, although the UK government has already announced that it hopes all coronavirus restrictions in England will be lifted by June 21**. 21,000 will attend a test event at Wembley on May 15 for the FA Cup final and there have been reports that something close to full capacity could be allowed by the time of the Euros. 

&#x200B;

**The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) has told UEFA that it cannot guarantee that fans will be able to attend Euro 2020 games in Dublin**, raising the prospect of matches being moved elsewhere. ""The Football Association of Ireland, on advice and guidance from the Government, has today notified UEFA that owing to the Covid-19 pandemic it is not in a position at this point to provide assurances on minimum spectator levels at the UEFA EURO 2020 matches due to be held in Dublin in June,"" the FAI said in a statement.

===============================================

Today's the deadline for Euro 2020(21) host cities to confirm minimum seating capacities to UEFA. Risks over Bilbao and Glasgow have largely abated, Dublin still the most in danger. Should anyone pull out, extra games almost certainly in England. **Announcement on April 19. Update for ticket holders likely Friday.** Most stadiums will likely be at 25% (ish) capacity, so fans will be given option of cancelling. If enough fans don't cancel, there will most probably be a ballot to determine who gets a ticket.

Scotland is surely in. FA has assured UEFA that government has guaranteed approximately 12,000 seats at Hampden for games there.

His heading ability is muted due to the fact that he’s getting double marked. What we need is someone else playing centrally up front with Kane so that they drag defenders off the other. On top of that, who can fill in for striker if we take Kane off? I’d argue the Calvert Lewyn plays the same style as Kane, but not as effectively (big, strong, hold up striker)

Spain showed great psyche coming back from the own goal and Croatia coming back equalizing. However, they do have some weaknesses in the back. This is very hard.

Don't really understand what the hype is or why they have such good odds as outright winner. Switzerland getting France down to the last penalty is huge no matter how poor France were playing and it should be a serious psychological edge.

Comment,3,h3fpnzo,,0,1625001523.0,"Fully agree - if they want to go for a big format, commit to it. This ""four best 3rd-finishers"" makes a mockery out of the third group stage match day as it clearly advantages those in groups E/F, while the third finisher from A/B might have to sit around for three full days with zero certainty.

I could easily imagine 8 more teams to fill up groups G and H (Norway, Greece, Ireland, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Serbia, Albania off the top of my head) - then you have a proper qualifying format for the round of 16.

&#x200B;

As for the flying around, I originally liked UEFA's idea of doing it this way once for the anniversary but I agree it should never come back and in light of COVID it looks even worse - the last thing you want right now is teams and thousands of supporters flying across Europe.

Hopefully in the future it'll go back to being single- or two- (max. three-)country bids",2021-06-30 00:18:43

The so called ""young genius"" players are nowhere near CR7, neither they can compare with Messi. Even with them having the worst season of their career. Please have some respect.
I have been watching him since his debut (i was a 12-13 year old teenager) and i only saw him improve more and more. There's a reason EVERY single nation team and clubs would have 3-4 defenders stationed for him when they play against his team. Why do you think that happens? Watch the game and the press conferences of the other teams before and after they play against him.

If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria are applied:[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020#cite_note-regulations-1)

1. Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;
2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;
3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;
4. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who are still level to determine their final rankings.[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020#cite_note-156) If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 10 apply;
5. Superior goal difference in all group matches;
6. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;
7. Higher number of wins in all group matches;[\[b\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020#cite_note-157)
8. If on the last round of the group stage, two teams are facing each other and each has the same number of points, as well as the same number of goals scored and conceded, and the score finishes level in their match, their ranking is determined by a [penalty shoot-out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)). (This criterion is not used if more than two teams have the same number of points.);
9. Lower disciplinary points total in all group matches (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card, 4 points for a yellow card followed by a direct red card);
10. Higher position in the [European Qualifiers overall ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020_qualifying#Overall_ranking).

But I just really don't get it. Maybe cause English is not my first language. Can someone please explain in more detail? Especially point 1 to 4. Like, aren't 1 to 3 all the same? Points in the match between the tied countries, goals between them and then goals between them again (?). And point 4, how can you do 1 to 3 again?

\- My biggest concern I have with this Netherlands side is not the players - it's the manager. Having a manager who's had bad spells wherever he went will not bode well with the players. The 5-3-2 formation 

\- In my opinion, there is an extremely fine line between him flourishing and him failing miserably in the Euros and had he still been coached by Koeman this would be a totally different story.

\- Having said this, Yilmaz is doing well for Turkey who looks like are going to have a very promising tournament ahead - the only thing that is holding me back from choosing him is the fixtures ***(Italy, Switzerland, Wales)*** in comparison to the Netherlands'. 

\- Speaking of fixtures, while the Netherlands are presumed to have the easiest group ***(Ukraine, Austria, North Macedonia)***, this could also well and truly backfire.

Some Euro Cup thoughts,4,ntiwil,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/ntiwil/some_euro_cup_thoughts/,7,1623004587.0,"Only 6 days left till Euro2020 will start and I am so excited!! Who could believe it, a year ago, that Euro 2020 will be played on 2021. And who could believe it will be played with fans at the stadium. Amazing. 

As going through the teams participating it seems like France is the stronger national team with Mbappe, Kante and even Benzema had a good season with Real Madrid. 

Having said that, I believe we will see a surprise and Belgium  will be this.year's winners. Lukako had an amazing year with Inter and KDB, if plays, was awesome with Man. City, it was sad to see him leaving the match crying in the CL finals. But with a strong defence and a good goalkeeper as Tibo I believe they will win it this time.

What about Portugal? Last cup winners won't qualify from the groups stage. After finishing 3rd in the last Euro Cup and winning the trophy eventually, I don't believe that this time they will have that luck with CR7.

The English team is also coming with a lot of hope as they have a strong team with many English youngsters that had a great season with their teams and there is a reason why 2 English teams got t9 the CL finals. But, I believe that the 3 lions will get to the quarter finals and lose. 

 La Roja, what can we tell about this Spanish team. After winning the Euro back to back and a world cup in between it seems like this national team will be very different from what it used to be. Without one of its biggest symbols, Sergio Ramos, and first time in the history without any Real Madrid players, this.team might surprise all and get to the final even, but if you ask me, they won't  qualify from the groups stage. 

What do you think guys? Who is your number one team to win this Euro? And who will surprise us all?

Anyway, I can't wait till it start and I am so happy it happening.",2021-06-06 21:36:27

They have a great squad and probably will go far but i watched them recently against Wales and they revealed again the main problems:

\- a weird defense . yes you read that well. Wales didnt score because of the lack of a proper striker on their side, but many times either France defense was to high or to low, giving wales to much space on both ocassions;

\- their main attacking point is getting the ball on the back of defense so that Mbappe can just run and maybe pass it to Benzema. If they play against a lower defense with a even a great counter attack, i wonder what will be their strategy;

\- Hugo Loris is not that great of a goalkeeper. Is name is know mainly because he plays for Spurs and France, not because of his goalkeeping habilities in my opinion

\- They won 3 - 0 but the goals only came after Wales was playing with 10 players.

&#x200B;

With this squad, they probably should have been having bigger results, but that is not the case. The last games were not won by a lot and they didnt play against any powerhouse: 

1 - 0 vs Bosnia , 2-0 vs Cazaquistan (jus 2 goals against the MIGHTY cazaquistan?...), tied 1-1 against Ucrania.

The only last powerhouse they played was against Portugal, where they one tied 0-0 and won the other by 1-0....

Is this really the GREAT team that will win the euro? Not in my opinion.

I purchased directly from the portal, I've been trying to time my re-entry to cover incremental times (8am, 8:15, 8:30, 8:45 etc) for example.

I did see the catergory 2 release this morning in the portal but if you're at that point you've again got the rigmarole of being the lucky one that actually gets the tickets in the cart. It's made more difficult by a captcha code that you have to enter to place them in your cart before purchase!

Hope this helps, the releases I've seen have sold within a couple of minutes so it's really tough but hopefully this will give everyone trying some hope at least!

Comment,2,h46ir1c,,0,1625557183.0,"Dude you are way too biased. Spain looked good against Slovakia, really?!? Thats your argument. They strugglied in literally every other match, everyone knows Croatia was not that good this year no, #9, an aging midfield and Persic out w/ covid vs Spain and still managed to conceed 3 goals. Then Switzerland took you all the way to penalties despite, being without their most important player (Xhaka) and down a man for 40min (the same team Italy destroyed 3-0 in the group stage)

As for this ""Italy is cooying Spain style"" nonsense:

A) Italy has a different style, yes they do possesion, but they do it faster, press higher, are more physical, and verticalize faster, which is why people actually enjoy watching that instead of the boring string of 200 side to side passes that put everyone to sleep Spain does.

B) Spain did not invent total football or the 4-3-3 the Dutch did, which just goes to show that just because you invented and perfected something, someone can come along and beat you at your own game (I'm sure you remember the 2010 WC)

C) Mentally you are still in the glory days of 2008-2012, sadly for you those days are gone, football has eveolved, the Spanish national team has changed, still has good-even great players, but its nowhere near the golden generation of 10 years ago.

THAT BEING SAID, anything CAN happen in football and Spain COULD beat Italy and make the final, but you analysis was biased garbage. 

My prediction, Spain will struggle to match Italy's intensity and break down their defense and loose 2-0.",2021-07-06 10:39:43

And while you could argue that this is the case every time there is a single host country whose team is also playing (home advantage), the amount of traveling is nowhere near comparable to this year. Not to mention the traveling restrictions for the fans, to the point that it will be like 95% Brits in the stands.

I also felt they team looked so comfortable in a quarter final of an international tournament. That feeling is quite unusual when it comes to England playing football during the knockout stages.  


Could Englan play gun-ho football. Yeah probably. Would that have backfired against the teams we have played so far. I think so, especially the game against Scotland. 

&#x200B;

Instead we are the first team not to concede a goal by the semi finals in a European tournament (might even be in any major international footballing tournament). Our ability to control the match is getting better and now our main striker is scoring goals.

&#x200B;

England is not a team anyone left will want to play against. A team that is hard to beat, good in possession and can as you put, turn it on like a switch.",2021-07-05 23:56:43

I suspect that they in fact has been underplaying or, at least, not showing all in their previous games on purpose to stay under the radar. They did not play at maximum power at all but whenever they needed to do so, they did. An example was what happened against Croatia after they committed the mistake. These players are beasts.

Comment,1,h4493a3,,0,1625511692.0,"I initially voted 24 like it is now and I understand the people that says that it would be better 32 like in the world cup to avoid that the teams of the last groups playing have advantage over those who already played for the winners of the third places. However world cup format of 8x4 ends up having something very stupid: matches where there is absolutely nothing at game either because the two teams are qualified or, even worse, because they are both already out. With the 24 format like in the two last Euros almost all matches are interesting and give chances to pass for the teams playing. This Euro produced only two uninteresting matches: the last ones of North Macedonia and Turkey because they were already out (Turkey nor mathematically but still needed like 8 goals or so to have chances).

This is the reason why I thing that groups should have three members and the format should be 16x3. With 16 groups of 3 we avoid uninteresting and unnecessary matches and at the same time we have and interesting group phase and the same amount of matches necessary to win the tournament just eliminating one stupid group phase match and adding another round of knockout. In total, like now, the team winning would play 7 matches but they would all be relevant. Additionally, in the group phase each team from each group would accumulate necessary resting time when the other two components of the group play.

The format I just proposed it is all advantageous for UEFA, football, footballers and aficionados. There would be more interesting matches but without putting more time of game over the same teams and all the matches in the final phase would be interesting. If, furthermore, we used the Euro as a way to qualify for the World Cup we could eliminate the stupid qualifying rounds and go directly to have an Euro each two years and a World Cup the years in between so every summer would be a competition but with even less matches necessary for the players after eliminating the unnecessary qualifying rounds that could be compensated via much smaller qualifying round for some places reserved for the weakest teams in the continent. With 3x16=48 places that gives enough room to do that.

I hope UEFA would read me. We need less unnecessary matches and more trascendental ones.",2021-07-05 22:01:32

Comment,3,h42ofu5,,0,1625469349.0,"I think the problem here is:

2. Nationalism is on the rise in the UK. Ever since 2016 (the thing that cannot be named) a lot of people who voted for it are doubling down on their choice with more flag shagging.

Its why i can't support England myself which is a shame. Apologies for it spoiling your evening and please don't think we're all like this.

Best of luck in the semis!

Comment,1,h425nbo,,0,1625459311.0,"England football and rugby supporter here. Just come back from England vs USA in the rugby today. 

No booing of the US national anthem whatsoever at the beginning of the game. The US played well today and scored a few tries - many England supporters applauded their tries (they did score a couple of crackers). When the US took conversions, we all respected the kicker by not making noise. Both teams were applauded at the end of the match.

I'm ashamed of many fellow England football supporters, especially after reading the experiences of the OP and other comments. They're a different breed to England rugby supporters - many football fans in this country simply lack class.

Just to echo the comments of Felix_Double - many England supporters are not like the ones the OP describes. Sadly I think it is a significant minority, possibly even a slight majority, are like what the OP describes. England football supporters could take a leaf out of the book of England rugby supporters.

altho the finals and semi finals are played in wembley (nobody complains about this, and this is considered a neutral stadium for a semi or final)  


the fact that england is no real host compared to the other hosts, but still plays more home games is a huge advantage (not even taking semi and final into account)  


i dont base my opponent on a team beating ukraine (wich isnt really a great team in the first place) their best player is litterly a defender that needed to score goals to advance and miraculous did so.  


then we come to germany, banning them from wembley the day before game forcing them not to train in advance is not fair play at all.  


also there have been various cases where official ticket retailers for matches against england make the opponent pay 10x the ticket value lol..  
i dont think that should even be a case, and again this is unfair.  


there is just to much advantage given to one team, and this is unseen in a big tournament like this.  
the only thing close to this is the south korea scandal and i honestly wont be surprised that after the euro's we get more leaks about this corupted tournament.  


again i dont have anything against england at all, but i do not like unfair advantages over other teams. certainly not the kind of advantages that have been happening, like the tickets and banning other teams to train etc etc..",2021-07-05 07:08:58

I mean that's a hard thing for English fans to cry when they've been  the ones that have booed all the other countries national anthems, and were singing 10 German Bombers outside the stadium in the lead up to the Germany game.

I don't think anyone hates the English squad at all (well aside from the British press who can't decide whether they love Sterling or his literally satan), but they're just awful winners... Like when they beat Sweden in last Euros (or maybe world Cup) and smashed up IKEA stores. 

Add to that England playing every game but one at home, a relatively easy route to the final (fair fucks with Germany though), Italy playing much more exciting football and Denmark being the world's favourite team right now, just no one, outside of the English really want them to win, but known its probably going to happen, and they'll never hear the end of it",2021-07-04 22:03:30

This is me saying “this is fucking annoying, I don’t like it and it’s making English people look terrible - to me” which is pretty unfortunate. More sad for the English than anyone. 

2. This is the second comment saying something about “man up” - the fuck? I’m allowed an opinion about this, and it has absolutely nothing to do with masculinity.

Lastly, I am a woman, so being yelled at by drunk strangers while walking home purely due to me wearing a jersey to of a team - WHICH ENGLAND DID NTO EVEN PLAY THAT DAY - is pretty unsettling and does not exactly make me feel safe 👍🏼",2021-07-05 03:41:51

Comment,2,h41dwbm,,0,1625445543.0,"Sorry if I sounded rude, I might got carried away from what I thought was an American lecturing us.

Football is a very passionate sport that, sadly, gather the worst of the worst. Sometimes I’m even ashamed of liking football because of the apes that goes to the stadium and it’s really cringe when I listen interviews with supporters.

Eastern Europe is no exception to that, so it is unfair to catalogue all of Eastern Europe because of the behaviour of the supporters. Britain won’t look much better if we only choose reactions from the supporters. It wasn’t so long ago when authorities started punishing racist behaviour from supporters. They will come there, hopefully, but at a different rhythm.

When I was a kid I’ve barely met black people on the streets. Nowadays is more globalised. But not in Eastern Europe because if you leave your country and your family is for the hope of a better life. And you can’t have a better life in an unstable country (the balkans were at war 30 years ago, Ukraine is at war right now), with a hell of a language (Slavic languages are VERY hard for a non native speaker, mention apart Hungarian) and where the inhabitants struggle to make ends meet.

With all that, I remember Brazilian players in Croatia and Ukraine. If we take also basket into account, there have been African American in some Eastern European countries.

your clearly not looking at all the advantage england is getting, and the advantage is unfair towards every other team.  
most teams were just tired and completly drained after 2 weeks of nonstop traveling, no climatising, no decent sleep because they were still traveling.

Comment,1,h417nu9,,0,1625442491.0,"I am afraid most people in football is not understanding that Spain nor Luis Enrique. This is how Luis Enrique teams play. The seem to be at the edge because they are conservative as fuck when they have the match and this is how Luis Enrique evolved tiki-taka in Barcelona. In fact, this is how he wan a triplet with them. We have to assume that Spain is playing something kind of different, and evolution of tiki-taka that most don’t understand. The reality is that Spain do not score because they *do not need it* but when they do need to score, they always do.

Previous imbatible Spain from 2008-2012 had a problem with keeping it up when they were not first scoring and this does not happen anymore. This time is like a rock: they do not get down never. Having seeing as many Euros as of now makes me crazy at how people is unable to see that the thing with Spain *is not luck at all even though it looks like that.* It, in fact, look like that because this is how Luis Enrique wants it to looks and he is being awesome at sending that image of weak team.

This Spain has the touch. Denmark and Italy also has something, of course. England has definitely nothing of that and they will not win.",2021-07-05 02:48:11

Comment,-1,h411umd,,0,1625439599.0,"Thanks for your reply. 

I didn’t disagree with anything you stated in your previous comment, just thought the approach was unnecessarily rude. It’s all good context and correct; i hear you.

Now that we have the posturing out of the way. 

I think the parallels between football and society are constantly changing and evolving yet will always be intangibly linked.  The fact that certain players and countries refuse to kneel for 10seconds before a game is suspicious and disappointing. Whether they’ve been told not to by their federations for political reason or have decided personally, all it means is that we all stand together against discrimination. That’s literally all it means, and you know as well as I do that discrimination exists all over the world; and forsure in Eastern Europe.  And if you don’t believe in that, then you don’t take the knee.

Through qualifiers and lowly CL qualification games the racist chanting etc and verbal attacks on black players most often from the Eastern European teams. 

Don’t forget that England fans were booing their own players for taking the knee prior to the tournament. I don’t associate myself with those fans either.  I suppose, the aforementioned reflection of society here that is a bubbling resurgence of right wing, authoritarian Nationalism creeping into the fabric of GLOBAL society. (Brazil, India, UK, US etc)

There are more diversities and ethnicities across most of the European teams today. You have to have a parent or grandparent from a country to play for them so the generational needle keeps moving. Just as a anecdotal obersevation; when I was growing up, Germany didn’t have black players. England had one.  Because of tech and travel we are diversifying ever more rapidly; yet somehow Eastern Europe drags it’s feet.",2021-07-05 01:59:59

My assumption on you being American is because you didn’t seem to know the reality in Europe. I’ve read many times criticism towards not being diverse enough when the reality is… that we are not so diverse.

Europe is predominantly white. And I’m not saying is a good or bad thing, it is a fact. And the more diverse countries are those I mentioned because of the reasons I mentioned.

About kneeling is also very personal and why I assumed you were American. Here is not happening because police in Europe don’t shoot to suspects just because they are black.

Point is I haven't watched an entertaining England match in years. 2-1 Italy or 2-1 Uruguay in 2014 were pretty exciting, but that was a while ago. 2-1 Iceland was a novelty, so that was really exciting (but not due to the football per se). 

So yes. You did what had to be done. Good. But I'm not going to treat England differently to, say, Portugal in 2016, the most boring tournament-winning team I've seen in a while. (Except Spain.) Good results don't necessarily comprise interesting football. Sadly.",2021-07-05 01:12:27
Comment,1,h40vpvm,,0,1625436402.0,"I'm saying ""had it easy"" is not simply the fifa rankings. If it were we wouldn't need to play football at all. Was Croatia easy for Spain? Was czech Republic easy for Netherlands? I guess France didn't lose to Switzerland either, if pre-tournament rankings are the arbiter of current quality and form.

Nobody is saying England has had it particularly hard, but it's extremely rare you have to play 7 amazing teams to win a tournament, and it's also rare that the top 8 ranked teams make up the QFs. Form matters, chance matters. Spain haven't been very good, so are they a tough opponent or not? We don't know, thats why we have the games. And even if one half is tougher tougher the other, so what? Each team only has to play a couple of them. Italy got austria, Spain got Croatia.

 I just think this kind of talk smacks of trying to diminish the achievements of teams you don't like, and there's enough of that on this sub. It's tedious.",2021-07-05 01:06:42

Comment,3,h40uaq1,,0,1625435646.0,"We’re terrible at languages but I think a large part of that is because we’re very fortunate in that most countries teach English as a second language because it’s a practical option. It’s the one commonly used in media, business and to bridge the language barrier between different countries. That’s undoubtedly caused us to be somewhat lazy, but we do also seem to struggle in deciding what second language to teach in schools. It used to be French and German, now there’s a whole range with some people thinking Spanish would be more sensible option for the masses etc. But we start teaching them far too late to actually be good at it.

I will say that when most people comment on your English it’s probably meant as a complement because we acknowledge that we’re absolutely garbage at it ourselves.",2021-07-05 00:54:06

Comment,3,h40u45c,,0,1625435553.0,"There's idiots in every country, in England they just like football a lot and I'm assuming the way the media keeps drumming on it gives them a good outlet to keep being idiots. Obviously it would do well to discourage that sort of behaviour, but it's easier said than done. It's never good to generalize people based on a very narrow sample like this though.


Like, I've never been more embarrassed to be Danish than I was at the DEN-FIN game at Parken where I and many other Danish fans were seated close to the Finnish fan section. Danish fans booing, throwing full cups of beer on the scoring Finnish player and fans sitting in front of them, and yelling insults at them. Obviously Danish fans were given a bit of a pass due to the Eriksen incident being traumatic to a lot of people on the stadium, and most of the Finnish fans I talked to had positive feelings despite everything. Mine were far from positive, but I can understand that was a very small minority of fans. But saying ""this would never happen in Denmark"" is a bit blind imho, we have our own idiots as well (I got enough and moved to another country as fast as I could lmao), and big emotions bring the worst out of those who are already dumb and disrespectful. DBU has definitely paid its fair share of fines of Danish fans being disrepsectful in tournaments in the past.",2021-07-05 00:52:33

Comment,2,h40ko0e,,0,1625429263.0,"Obviously in the long run it gets less obvious, because very few teams actually play at home after the group stage. My point was more for the group stage, where pretty much in every group 2 teams had the home advantage against the other 2 teams, which had to keep travelling between the two countries. And obviously it won't help everyone, a home advantage won't suddenly make a bad team play well. Better maybe, but won't solve technically issues etc. Statistics for host team having benefit in normal scenario are pretty thin actually, and there's also a lot of pressure that comes with it. It's not a guaranteed thing. The travelling between several countries is more my issue here, rather than who gets to play at home. And as said, can't really say how much it actually gives benefit, but it does put more teams in unequal position.",2021-07-04 23:07:43

then got the advantage to play home over a host country (scotland)

Comment,-1,h40j4ni,,0,1625427957.0,"I meant in terms of money/focus, youth sports centers and money spent on youth leagues and we were all only talking about football. 

>	They are all small countries where sport options are quite big. Its crazy to expect that small countries (most are around 4-5 mil population) will be able to produce semi-final worthy teams for every single footballing tournament.

This is false, there are plenty of countries in 5-10M range in all europe with significant differences in levels of success. There is a reason why belgium or denmark have had more success. Money is one, well applied money in youth leagues is another.

Romania and Bulgaria used to be football teams with strong presences, they didn’t come down, but others that got better focused on building players and capabilities, specially youth. This is one example of what the OP was talking about.

No one said “semi-final worthy teams for every single football tournament was the minimum expected.” You made that up to say others are wrong and you are right. This is a strawman fallacy argument

Comment,2,h40j123,,0,1625427871.0,"its not about being first class, they have to fly day before every game, and straight after every game usually late at night, got to wait for the plane being loaded, then fly out on 2-3 hr trips.  
arrive, get luggage, drive to the hotel and sleep.  
basically they are active during the night up till the morning instead of sleeping.  
next day training or possible entire day rest because of it.  


then theres the factor of climatisation, for belgium they had to go from belgium to russia, to belgium to denmark, to belgium, to russia, to belgium, to seville.  
for example in denmark the temps were about 19-20 degrees, while in seville it jumped to 37. in russia it would be as low as 16 to 20 degrees, while in belgium it was about 30 degrees again..  


thats basically jumping from +- 30 to 20 to 30 to 20 to 30 to 37 on a short notice, and a body needs longer then a day to climatise.  


do this every game including playing 90 minutes and you'll be tired.

I'm a lot more confident today about England reaching the final - past England teams would have underestimated Ukraine and either lost or scraped through 2-1. 

Denmark are playing really well though, really good teamwork and organisation - and they're clearly very motivated to do it for Eriksen. 

Certainly not a foregone conclusion, and if England are going to lose, I'd rather it be to a Denmark team on an unlikely run to the final than Spain or Italy just adding another trophy to their cabinet.",2021-07-04 22:23:53

Win To Nil Betting Odds,1,o171na,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/o171na/win_to_nil_betting_odds/,1,1623884795.0,"After the Russia v Finland game that is 8 out of 13 matches ending TO NIL. Many times the 1x2 odds are restrictive or odds on, the win to nil option gives a bit more value. You can of course split your bet between 1x2 and the better win to nil odds. Prior to the kick-off, I created a blog about this and it has already proved fruitful. 

I will be looking at this in other games during the group stages, certainly with Croatia v the Czechs on Friday.",2021-06-17 02:06:35

The crosses into the box not threatening. They seemed to be composed in their back, coming out with ball smoothly even when france pressured them. Maybe move Kimmich to middle, have no idea what Haverts is doing out there of course  getting behind on your own goal is a bummer and playing at home may have been little stressful. Interesting if they'll have enough time before ko round to get it together.

France looked comfortable, played their game, back line great Pogba dominating a lot of pace Mbappe, team looking nice.",2021-06-16 17:30:42

The current Euro format is all wrong. It encourages defensive football. Euro 2016 was one of the worst tournaments with one of the lowest scoring tournaments. Changing the format to where only 8 teams can qualify from 6 groups of 24 will make the tournament more attacking and more goals will come.,0,nzy58q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/nzy58q/the_current_euro_format_is_all_wrong_it/,26,1623736591.0,"I had the feeling that Euro 2016 was one of the worst Euros of all time and Euro 2000 was probably the best ever euro. Sure enough Euro 2000 had the highest goal on average per match, 2.74, [while Euro 2016 was one of the lowest scoring tournaments](https://www.espn.com/soccer/european-championship/story/2910658/euro-2016s-107-goals-so-far-lowest-at-european-championship-in-20-years). Even in this version of the tournament, except the Netherlands vs Ukraine match, every other match has had little to no quality and very few teams have shown attacking intent.

I blame the format for that. The format itself encourages defensive football, it encourages teams to play for a draw. 16 team qualifying from 24 the 2nd round, which means 3 teams from at least 4 groups can qualify. It's bad format, because it means many teams can qualify without even winning a game in the group phases.

In my experience, the best format, for a tournament of 24 teams, is when 8 teams qualifies from 6 groups of 24 teams. Champions League 1999 was played in that format and that was probably the best ever UCL. It's a format that encourages team to go for it and seek 3 points as much as possible. If some teams have nothing to play for in the last match, teams then feel free and play attacking football too. This current format ruined the Euros.

UEFA might be reluctant to change because it means we will have 8 fewer matches, but in the long run this will turn off the spectators from this tournament, which will hurt the revenue. It's about quality, not quantity. UEFA needs to realize that and need to change the format to encourage more adventurous football.",2021-06-15 08:56:31

Possibly a stupid question,2,nzrqui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/nzrqui/possibly_a_stupid_question/,11,1623719627.0,So obviously every team has their 26 man squads and all that but they are only allowed so many players on the bench. What do those players who aren’t in the starting XI or on the bench even do while that game is happening. (Sancho w/ the England v. Croatia game) Do they just go home? Do they watch the game in the stadium somehow? Do they still go travel with the team?,2021-06-15 04:13:47

UEFA RANT,6,nzh1k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/nzh1k4/uefa_rant/,31,1623683449.0,"It's been great having EURO 2020 finally on our TV.

And a great result for England fans yesterday for beating Croatia 1-0......except it isn't.

All it has done is boost our chances of winning group D. And the winner of group D plays the runner-up of group F...........likely to be one of France, Portugal or Germany.

The runner-up of our group plays the runner-up of group E......assuming Spain win that group, the runner-up will be Sweden, Poland or Slovakia.........

So the group D winners play a runner-up of another group, and the runners up of group D play.........a runner-up of another group?! I thought winning a group was supposedly meant to give you some kind of advantage, but not here. It just rewards losing.

The tournament was great in it's 16 team format. Very competitive and the format was simple and easy to follow. Did anyone ever hear one fan watching Euro 2012 and go ""you know what, they need to make this tournament bigger!""

If they HAVE to expand it, just like they seem to expand everything now, why not make it 20 teams in 4 groups of 5.......at least qualifying for the knock-out stage would still make sense by having the top 2 teams in each group qualify for the quarter finals.

The fact that North Macedonia and Scotland can qualify is non-sensical too......again, it encourages losing, because if someone in Nation League C drops down to D, they aren't going to be upset, they'll just think ""great, weaker opposition now to play against to qualify for the next EURO's"", so losing is rewarded again.

And I'm not going to start talking about the new Europa League Conference - again, I don't believe there was one fan in the world going ""you know what football needs - a third tier European competition!"". Who is going to watch this?!

To summarise...........UEFA are a joke, they are taking away competitiveness which is at the centre of all sport, and they have ruined EURO's for the foreseeable future.

FIFA have also ruined things.....the next world cup is in the middle of winter and after that it changes to a 3-team group format which looks awful, just to accommodate more teams (even though teams will play fewer games when they get knocked out at group stage), meaning the future of international football is terrible.

I know I haven't made any original points here just wanted to get it off my chest.",2021-06-14 18:10:49
MY THOUGHTS ABOUT TURKEY,5,nzh0ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/nzh0ea/my_thoughts_about_turkey/,8,1623683291.0,"I was really thinking good about Turkey squad that they would manage sth really good in this tournament and after their game with Italy it didn't change for me. I'm still thinking that they will achieve group stage and gonna do at least QF, and they can be the underdog of this tournament.   


What do you think about them and how do you find the squad of Turkey when u think about the names that they have",2021-06-14 18:08:11

A team that controls the box can a) create their own chances b) come from behind.

Who's their #9?, anyway to get Lewandowski dutch citizenship :)

Which image do you let exist? #Eriksen,8,nytfki,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/nytfki/which_image_do_you_let_exist_eriksen/,5,1623608664.0,"First i like to say that UEFA made a huge mistake in my opinion. The moment i saw the the CPR on my television. Zoomed in was just horrible. Yeah i know, this happens. Part of life. But i really don’t know why they didn’t cut the broadcast and went back to the national tv studios. I’m an adult, and it was tough to see. But there are also children watching that match, just before bed time. And they saw there great hero fighting for his live. Some know what was going on and some don’t.

But what image do you let exist? Huge respect how captain Kjear reacted on the situation. Called the medics as one of the first and got his team standing around the medics to protect there for life fighting teammate from tv-camera’s. How Kjear took care of Eriksen’s wife. Great respect how he handled the situation, which also was unbelievable tough for him and the rest of the team. Great respect for the Finnish team who gave a applause to the Danish team when they entered the field. This is how hou show respect and full professionalism. 

I will keep this in my mind and my thoughts go out to #Eriksen. 🍀",2021-06-13 21:24:24

However, with today’s defeat do you think it is still possible for Denmark to advance to the round of 16? Without Eriksen in the squad and with the team still likely rattled, I don’t see how they can get a result against Belgium.

Euro2020 irritating experience with EPSN+ subscription in USA,14,nyckzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/nyckzx/euro2020_irritating_experience_with_epsn/,22,1623549998.0,"Subscribed with espn+ for watching Euro2020. Unfortunately the experience with ESPN has been a nightmare so far . Suggestions to overcome this would be helpful --

1. ESPN advertised -- you can subscribe to espn+ for 6$ monthly and watch euro live. Pretty good deal so far . Unfortunately what they didnt mention is-- you can only view the ""multi-view"" broadcast of the game with espn+. The multi view is essentially spider camera angle with no replays, no close in views and nothing like conventional soccer camera angle. The only way to understand the game is to listen to commentary. And again, the commentaries are even not the good enough. My best guess is -- they have managed to get some secondary commentary for this multi-view option.  
2. The biggest and annoying part is -- if you want to watch live programs (-- EURO2020 game--) on TV through ESPN app, you need to go through an activation step every time you want to launch it. You need to open your browser on pc or mobile->go to espn website-> input the activation code shown on TV and then only you can watch. Sometimes, the activation will ask for TV provider which is absolutely ridiculous . 
3. Every time you switch the channel or game, you will need to follow the activation step. This is the worst  experience I have ever had watching any live sports event through subscription package.
4. You will need a separate package to watch the main-view (say the traditional camera angle) game. Which costs more -- I guess 60$+.
5. The customer care is a mess. I knocked them to overcome the activation issue. They took more than an hour to check my account and didnt bother to suggest anything.  My understanding is ESPN already knows this issue and wont solve the problem in an way to force buy the expensive packages.
6. The other apps/subscription I have tried so far like the paramount+ /CBS, nbcsports pass, nfl, fubotv are pretty straight forward and provides better experience compared to espn+. I would never recommend espn+ to anyone.
7. I would say their marketing of espn+ bundle is kind of shady and uses trickery to sell it to sports fan. ESPN doesn't provide clear cut answers on contents and watch-ability experience. This is pretty disappointing given that they are one of the leaders of sports streaming in USA and overall world. Expected better from ESPN.",2021-06-13 05:06:38

"Euro and World Cup tournaments: do teams now only play in white jerseys versus any national colours (predominantly red), or is it my imagination?",1,nya67s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/nya67s/euro_and_world_cup_tournaments_do_teams_now_only/,6,1623543022.0," So apparently Italy didn't play in their national colours yesterday (  azzurro Savoia ?), the famous azure blue colour, instead they appeared  their first match in white. Today Wales played in red versus Switzerland  completely in white, so even the socks. See the pattern here? Upcoming  matches are Danmark - Finland, Belgium - Russia, England - Croatia,  Macedonia - Austria .. and I wouldn't be surprised if all these teams  were red and white as well. I also noticed this in the previous  tournaments. I couldn't tell Serbia and Switzerland apart, and I don't  mean politically!! It took me a while to find out who was white and who  was red. Since when is this normal? Do half the viewers watch  tournaments on tablets or phones or any other small screens? I can  remember when Brazil's secondary jersey was navy blue. What is the point  of having national colours when all you get to see is white vs red? Is  this necessary? I can imagine if you had a tiny b/w television in 1970  and you couldn't tell the teams apart, but we are living in 2021 and we  can easily identify the teams. I have no idea why they do this, are  there new jersey conditions I am not yet aware of?",2021-06-13 03:10:22

It's not only playing for your home audience, the advantage teams like Italy, Spain, Germany and Denmark have is also due to not having to stress for travels, spend time in transfer/transportation etc. My own country, Sweden, has to travel from Sevilla where they meet Spain, to S:t Petersburg! That's like 4000km! 

Has there been any word of the philosophy behind this? Like, why is nobody complaining? Why isn't, for example, Sweden being able to play at least one of their matches in their own country? Or am I overthinking this?",2021-06-13 01:19:29

No big deal, but I personally liked the Euro 2016 version on the anthems better. Anyways just wanted to point this out and see if anyone else noticed it too",2021-06-13 00:06:05

All arriving in the Russian Federation want to oblige to leave for isolation

https://www.interfax.ru/russia/771827

This is a Google translate
Moscow. June 11th. INTERFAX.RU - Arriving on the territory of Russia, including foreign citizens, will be obliged to comply with the isolation regime until the results of two tests for coronavirus are obtained; it is proposed to amend the decree of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor of the Russian Federation.
This is stated in the draft resolution of the Chief State Sanitary Doctor , published on the official portal of normative acts for public discussion.
According to the document, citizens must pass two PCR tests for coronavirus within five calendar days from the date of arrival in the Russian Federation. In this case, the interval between the first and second research should be at least a day. Citizens must self-isolate at home pending test results.
At the moment, citizens arriving in the Russian Federation, including foreign ones, do not comply with the isolation regime after passing the coronavirus test.

In addition, it is proposed to exempt from passing mandatory testing for COVID-19 those citizens returning to the Russian Federation who have undergone a course of vaccination against the disease or have acquired immunity to the virus as a result of a previous illness.
""At the same time, it is mandatory to post in the EPGU (portal of State Services - IF) information on the availability of vaccination against COVID-19 or the results of a study for the presence of IgG immunoglobulins to COVID-19 in the range of positive reference values ​​in relation to the test system used in this study."" , - says the draft resolution.
At the same time, from July 1, citizens of the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union, when crossing the state border of the Russian Federation, will confirm the presence of a negative result for COVID-19 using the ""Traveling without COVID-19"" mobile application, the draft document says.
From May 1, by the decree of the chief sanitary doctor, compulsory re-testing for coronavirus was introduced for all arriving in Russia. Testing must be completed within five days from the date of entry into the country",2021-06-12 05:17:07

I know i'll need a test which is okay and I'm willing to bend the rules but would rather not end up in a London jail facing fines if i don't have to.

Lockdown means sparetime so i've created a hobby project where you can predict the Euros and get automatically updates,4,nw6e0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/nw6e0z/lockdown_means_sparetime_so_ive_created_a_hobby/,0,1623301651.0,"Just a little hobby project i thought i'd share here. Its free and no ads or whatever.

You have to register but thats just to keep track of your score.

&#x200B;

We used to predict Euros/World Cup using an excel sheet at my job, but i thought i might as well do something that actually gives us some statistics and auto corrections.

Its fairly simple:

1) You create a competition and invite people to predict in it (or just predict in someone elses).

2) Prediction is done by first betting the outcome of the group games, followed by selecting teams to each playoff phase, and finally you're supposed to find a sensation team/dark horse, that will give you extra points if they make it far.

3) Come Friday, all bets in your competition will be public, and the site will calculate some statistics, such as how many percent of the bets believe France will win, how many believe Italy will make it to the semi finals, etc.

4) All scores and standings are automatically updated after each game.

&#x200B;

Feel free to give it a go! Just create a competition on the below URL and then share it to let friends predict in it.

Hækkerup, the son of Hans Kristian Hækkerup, a politician, was active in politics from the end of the Second World War to his death in 1979. He was the chairman of the youth organization of the Danish Social Democrats from 1946 to 1952 and the secretary general of International Union of Socialist Youth from 1946 to 1951. Hækkerup is most widely known for the agreement he reached with the Norwegian Minister Jens Evensen that gave Norway the oil-rich Ekofisk oil field in the North Sea.

Should be some norwegian as well.. Remember some years ago the Morten Olsen (danish national coach) called the norwergians ""fjellaper"" (mountain-apes).. The danes doesn't likes the norwegians.. It is also the same from the norwegian side.. A typical urban myth in norway is that norway got one of its oil fields in the north sea through negotiations where the [danish minister was drunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_H%C3%A6kkerup)..

Eventhough.. norwegian media love to portay the norwegians and the danes as brothers/sisters.. Generally the norwegians are more into the ""swedish stuff"".. doesn't care that much about denmark (they can't ski)..",2021-07-08 05:34:55

Comment,-2,h4d4ame,,0,1625701032.0,"Yo, take a minute. I accidentally have started a massive war between europe in the comments here. My comments imply that I simply ""hate england"" but that isn't the case. Although England has racist fans, I know that doesn't relate to all of them. Everyone is quick to jump to hate on what I said without taking a minute and thinking ""wait, maybe this guy is taking the piss"". Everyone here is taking this so seriously and I didn't mean for that to happen.

Brexit or political matters do not influence what I think of Britain.

England, just like any other country, has had some significant times playing football not only in the euros, but in any tournament, and I'm not taking that away from the team. They really can be a football powerhouse when they play well together.

All in all, what I want to say is that I have no hatred towards English people as a whole, only to the ""minority of knobheads"" you referenced to. Sorry if you took it any other way.",2021-07-08 02:37:12

This hatred towards England is tiresome now, the 'Its Coming Home' thing is actually a bit of a self piss take about how shite we've been over the years, listen to the words.

Brexit and xenophobia has a lot to to do with the way England is viewed and unfortunately there are a lot of racist idiots in England, and the wider UK. The Scottish National Party hates the English with a Xenophobic passion, but its ok because its aimed at England. 

I wish some people would just admit England have played some exciting football at times and are getting better under Southgate. We have had the so called Golden Generation so many times it actually feels good to have acteam to be proud of.

Was it wrong? Probably. But I can't see in any way how it's dirty or giving them an unfair advantage. That just sounds like an excuse to me.

If I'm honest with you, what's bugging me about this is that England are usually shit. Let's be honest about it. We're famous for choking. We finally have a good tournament and a team to be proud of and then I see people like you coming up with excuses for that success. Can't you just be humble and let us have it for once? God knows it won't last long. Even if we win this tournament (which I doubt) we'll go straight back to being shit again I'd bet. I know with current affairs we're not exactly popular at the moment but come on, give us some credit when it's finally due instead of coming up with dumb reasons as to why we are where we are. Our team earnt this, they weren't given it thanks to Ed Sheeran's magical voice.

I hope Diaz goes on to do really well. I think he's at Porto; I hope he stays there for a bit and builds on this. James made a mistake of a huge move after WC 2014 and he wasn't the same since. He's refound form at Everton though. 

I only watched the knock out games, not the group games but Colombia did better than I thought they would without Falcao and James. They really need a new striker to come through though, it was clear what they were missing to me.

Comment,2,h4cbjj1,,0,1625685243.0,"I'm Canadian so we don't get much if any of this stuff except whatever I see online or quickly on TV hits.

That said, I'm curious of the breakdown and why England seems like a lock (at least here it seems like a foregone conclusion they're beating Denmark).

England, yes, is higher ranked (4 vs 10). But that doesn't seem like much to me imo.

England's group stage opponents were ranked 14, 40 and 44. For an average ranking of just over 32.

Denmark group stage opponents were ranked 1st, 38, 54. For an average ranking of 31.

Denmark scored 4 goals in group stage to England's 2. And both have scored 6 goals in knock out stage.

Some probably not important stats but still tell an interesting story imo:

Possession % has Denmark at 4th overall with 54.2% and England 6th at 53.4%

Total attempts has Denmark with 90 (37 on target) to England's  37 (15 on target).

Denmark also has traveled almost 4x more than England, due to playing in Baku that one time.

England though has kept a 100% clean sheet.

All this to say, man...should be a way tighter game than the internet is saying and wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if Denmark takes it.

Comment,2,h4cbdox,,0,1625685111.0,"Don't TV channels from all countries big up their own teams? Afterall it's what brings in the biggest audience (and consequently advertising money), and of course England are no different. I do think England sometimes suffer from over-exposure in other countries, but they are English TV channels afterall.

The English media clearly generally go over the top with 1966 and all that (makes me cringe), but are you sure they actually say those things on TV? I've never heard ITV or BBC even mention England while covering another game (last night for example), except advertsing the game.

And don't forget England have actually been bookies favourites for every game they've played so far, so who can blame us for being confident?",2021-07-07 22:11:51

Comment,1,h4c443f,,0,1625678319.0,"The two designated time slots for matches for the EURO 2020 follow a similar pattern to international and continental tournaments elsewhere. Simple answer is, 21 hs in most European countries is the ""prime time"" for night TV and yields the biggest audiences. Sometimes, these get adjusted (like when France played Australia in the 2018 WC), but since Europe has 3 or 4 time zones, it was not necessary.

Similar thing happens in the Copa América, last night Argentina played Colombia at 22 hs local time (a bit late, not that bad) which is 3 am here in Central Europe (I still woke up because I'm Argentinian). The match is not meant to be sold to international audiences, so they just try to cover the prime time of South America and a plausible kick off time for Northern American viewers.

And stop this idiot thing about the “easy route”

They still have to win the matches and football fan’s should know by now that there is no “easy” in football.

Small nations have fared well in the past, knocking out some “big teams” along the way.

Iceland v England 
Denmark v france
Switzerland v France
Czech v Holland 

And so on.. now a days even smaller nations have a lot of players, playing in good clubs around Europe. IMHO there is no easy games anymore.

Comment,1,h4azup2,,0,1625649976.0,"  
Yeah it could be an option, there are probably many possibles ways to  
settle it, I think one of the issues like it often is, is  
conservatism, for example the VAR (Video assistant referee), is  
something that many people have demanded over the years to curb the  
issue of wrong calls, or players getting red cards because someone  
decided to play dead on the grass, of goals scored unfairly (like  
maradona's hand) etc... and only now after decades it has started  
being implemented, and not even on a regular basis, there's still  
lots of controversial calls.  
Allowing for  
unlimited player rotation might be a pretty big change to implement  
for some, they barely agreed on trying out on some tournaments a rule  
to allow additional substitutions of players who received head  
injuries while they get checked up, before that they only allowed for  
a 3 minutes break (rule that only exists since 2014).  
And in the end, even tough shootouts are mostly luck, it's not just luck, and you can't  
say Spain deserved to win more than Italy either, they seemed to  
dominate the game, but they lacked decisiveness at the end, as  
they’ve lacked in most of their games, even after some pretty big blunders bi the Italian defense they just couldn’t seem to do much with it. Just look at  
the stats, Spain did 16 goal attempts, only got 4 on target, Italians  
did 7 and also got 4 on target, both got one goal. In the end Italy  
went for a tried and boring strategy that has worked for many, it  
doesn’t mean they are worse than Spain, I’d  still rather watch them  
play as they did on their other games.",2021-07-07 12:26:16

Comment,7,h4aw7px,,0,1625648055.0,"Don't mean to be rude, but player rotation or re-entry of subs is never going to happen. 

Firstly football is very traditional, it took 20 years of lobbying to give refs the ability to watch replays and change on&field decision. 

Secondly, more rotation or sub-reentry like hockey would completely change the tactical duel, that you as a newbie don't even realize is happening, and that so many fans (like me) really enjoy, it adds so much drama and complexity. 

Thirdly, penalties are highly dramatic, nerve-racking, and effective way to decide a stalemate; although there is an element of luck, it is not a coin-flip. Imagine taking a penalty during a shootout... you have just spent 2 hours doing very high intensity cardio, you've run (sprinting often) for about 6miles, your legs are heavy and your muscles tired, you step to the spot to execute a seamingly simple shot while there is a professional keeper in front watching your every move hopping you'll tip him off and reveal where you're shooting, meanwhile you are carrying the hopes and dreams of you your entire country.

Penalties are a physical and psychological gauntlet, and I don't think we'll find a better way to settle a tied match.",2021-07-07 11:54:15

Italy showed great composure and heart and I'm glad we're through. But hats off to our Spanish brothers, who's team played their best game in the tournament, and have a very promising young team who will eventually bring success as long as they find some more clinical finishing. Also well played, Luis Enrique, I though that his desicion to play a false nine was brilliant and it would have paid dividends with better finishing.",2021-07-07 11:24:35
Comment,2,h4as21z,,0,1625645857.0,"You deserved this game guys, let's be honest here. You really deserved to win this game. The actual problem with Spain was their problems in putting the ball in the net. I mean with 908 passes you guys just got 16 shots of which 4 on target.

Great team, really the masters of possession football. They’ll be ready to give us another great show next year for the WC!

Also, a big applause to Luis Enrique.
A great manager, and a great man as well!
Thanks for the nice words he spent to Italy after the match!

I don’t know if we will win the cup, but if we will, then part of the credit will have to go to Spain.
They challenged our team like no one before, forcing us to take a step back from the aggressive football we played until tonight, and discover who we really are as a team under that kind of pressure they imposed on us.
You can’t learn what you really can do, if not by going through an hell of a situation.

Comment,1,h4amb5n,,0,1625642777.0,"O.K. Correct me if I'm wrong. I scrolled up and saw that there were 17 players on each team that played in the game. Only 5 players on each time played for 120 minutes. How about this idea? Why can't each team expand their roster from 17 players on each team to 22 players on each team? This way each team could rotate their players in and out of the game more often. After the first regulation period, when the game is tied, the play-off period would immediately be a sudden death period. Whoever scores the first goal wins. After each 1/2 hour sudden death period, there are 10 minute breaks. Eventually, someone will score a goal. Maybe the era of the ""Golden Goal"" was the correct method of deciding a game but the rules and regulations needed improvement? Just an idea.",2021-07-07 10:26:17

Comment,1,h4akkap,,0,1625641871.0,"Spain played the better game against a more proficient team. I really feel if they hadn't missed that first penalty and gone through the remaining four with the advantage, it would have swung the outcome in their favour. Italy's relief after it went over the crossbar was palpable through the television.

Ultimately, if England win tomorrow, they have a tougher challenge in the final. That could also easily be decided by a penalty shootout. And again I would expect the result of such a scenario to favour Italy. I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for some of that Sterling and Kane magic on Sunday if all goes well tomorrow.",2021-07-07 10:11:11

Anyway, As an Italian I have to give it to Spain, they played a wonderful game and for most of the time were better than us, so well done! But I think that in the end from what we have demonstrated throughout the tournament we deserved to be in the final.

Comment,1,h4aj0eo,,0,1625641078.0,"Bold of you to assume it will be against England. We've played really bloody well this tournament and became the first team in history to get to the semis without conceding a single goal but I think our streak will be broken and Denmark will win just like Croatia did in the WC. The match is going to give me a heart attack.

But if we do manage to beat the Danes it will not end up in a 3/1 for Italy. Not after what I've just witnessed against Spain. Everybody thought Italy would thrash Spain because of how mediocre they've played this tournament but Spain had most possession and that equalizer pushed them into overtime. Even with an extra 30 minutes it was still 1 - 1. Spain had a lot of missed opportunities but Italy had good defence. Yet it still went to pens. Nobody expected it to go to pens and Spain could have very well won on that. They got there in the end but I expected much more from Italy.",2021-07-07 09:57:58

Comment,5,h4aiwwp,,0,1625641030.0,"There's also the fact that in Football, dominating the game doesn't necesarily means deserving the win, some teams opt for counter attack strategies not because they can't play otherwise, but because they actually see that as the best strategy, I didn't particularly enjoyed the way Italy played tonight, and even tough entertaining it was far from the best game of the Euro.

In the end like others have said the ""golden goal"" existed at some point and it didn't work out, and in the end if after 2h or playing none of the teams manages to secure the win I don't think it's unfair to decide that done of them deserves the win more than the other, and go for a more luck oriented way of deciding the victor, penalty kicks are still better than a coin flip.

And like always teams aren't always 100% consistent in their games, with 11 players and the the rotations, there's a lot of variables, like Spinazzola that was a key player for Italy getting injured last game, but overall Italy have played some of the best football of the whole cup, even if not in this last game in particular.

denmark is a top 10 team yes, but england is playing them tomorow in semi final.. havent had any competition so far (germany is broken for years now, cant count them as competition) germany has had issues for the last years, scoring issues and they still rebuilding with fresh players, they wont/cant compete for anything untill earliest the next euro edition.  


spain also encountered switzerland, wich again played a great tournament and prob should be still in it after all (to bad they fucked those penaltys up really hard).  
and they just lost to italy now, should have lost to switzerland aswell.  


denmark, played belgium and czech republic (who like switzerland played a great tournament and were better than this germany)  


england faced germany, you honestly cant say they were on the level of spain, italy, belgium, switzerland or even czech republic..   
yes they'll play denmark finally an entree top 10 team, but they are/should not be considered the level of named above teams (with exceptions of czech republic, denmark is ofcourse better than those).

Comment,-3,h4actf4,,0,1625638049.0,"People, please don't hate on me for my comments. I am a newbie. A typical stupid American who calls football, ""soccer."" I don't know anything about this sport but I sat through the entirety of this Italy / Spain game. I have seen less than 5 football matches in my lifetime. I'm one of those people who think that watching football is like watching paint dry. I know. I am in the minority. I warned you that I was stupid. So take what I say with a grain of a salt...

The reason why I'm writing is I still don't get why in the world is an entire game decided by penalty kicks? I've seen this before. It just doesn't make sense to me. Today, Italy won by luck. With penalty kicks it can go either teams way. What's the point of it? Why don't they continue to play the game in overtime until a goal is scored in sudden death?

I've heard the reason that players are too tired after the first overtime. Again, this doesn't make sense to me. They get paid hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars a year to be in tip-top shape. They make more money than working class people earn in a lifetime and that's the reason, they're too tired? It's athletics. Of course they are going to get tired. Also, throughout the game each team is rotating players in and out of the game so players do get rest.

Why can't there be a second sudden death overtime where newer, fresher players are rotated into the game? It will show depth in each team and the winning goal will show talent, depth, and perseverance.

Another sport where players are tired is Wimbledon tennis. The fifth and final set must be won by two games, not by a tie-break. I've seen matches close to 6 hours long. They are riveting and epic. Baseball goes into endless innings too though baseball isn't as taxing on the players. My point is that the ending of a football game should be exciting and epic. When Italy kicked the winning goal it was anticlimactic.

I was amazed by both Andrea Pirlo’s and Gigi Buffon’s playing and have idolized them and Italy ever since. The team’s sadly been quite gone for some recent tournaments, but seeing the breath of fresh air that is Italy’s current lineup, I’ve been hoping and believing that they bring it Rome this time.

get the fuck out my dude, this is not the same format as any other past tournament, wich only had 1 host in the first place.  
no single country in past tournaments had ground advantage while not being host, england is no host but still benefits more than hosts.  
and its not only that, you can read (i hope), its not only having the home advantage, also traveling, corupt ticket sales, banning opponent team from training in the stadium but go train themself.  
i just wonder if you just reply without readin my comments or you just stoopid?

What bothers it’s that the focus of the complains is not the way Spain plays and no the way rivals play against them.

After all , as it says in 3 lions ""we've seen it all before, we just know, we're so sure"".

Comment,2,h50oyb1,,0,1626196837.0,"But we are scum, the proof was there for all to see. Calling a crying 11 year old nazi scum. Leaving so much piss in Leicester Square it looked like it rained. Barging our way into our own stadium without tickets and not only occupying OTHER PEOPLES BOUGHT SEATS, also OCCUPIED THE DISABLED GANTRY. Terrifying Italian families, racist abuse of our players. Booing the anti-racism stance of our players. 

How is that not England? Because I saw it everywhere. That is our nation now. What people don't understand is that saying ""I'm not so stop saying we're scum"" isn't helping. It allows people to act this way. Imagine if the crowd of legitimate Wembley ticket holders turned on them. Imagine if fans shining lasers in players eyes were told to stop being dicks and got thrown out because other fans had told the stewards. Imagine if the majority of great English people everywhere hadn't just gone ""I'm not like that, that's not england"" and done something. Hell, Imagine if we were just a responsible nation when it came to drink!

I'm not saying it will be easy, but just like I can see the upward trajectory our teams on, I can also see the slow return to the football hooligan heyday. 

After showing England for its true self, to the whole of Europe at least over the last month, I hope we never get to host another men's tournament again. 

As one of my friends so eloquently said;

Never has a nation deserved it less but a team deserved it more.

Comment,7,h50os2f,,0,1626196671.0,"I think everyone is tired of the “it’s only a minority” thing to explain away how England isn’t racist or violent. Everyday there are thousands of racist incidents. Football and racism in this country are deeply linked. The thuggery, beatings, booing of Athems by huge crowds  have really exposed what a racist country we are and how every black person is made to feel unsafe walking back from the pub on what could have been a historic night. For too long we think we’re the least racist in Europe or compared to Eastern Europe or compared to the 1920s and that somehow makes things ok. I’m glad other countries are looking at us and calling us racist, because we are, and maybe we can stop pretending it’s not a problem and actually deal with it.",2021-07-13 20:17:51

As I said all the pundits constantly ask or say to each other they think it's coming home or I can feel its coming home. You are saying this now because you lost but before the final all you got from English was that it was coming home and it was your time blah blah blah. Seriously I get it the song is interpreted in different ways but the majority of the time it is used in a ""were gonna win the tournament way"" and very few are taking the piss out therselves when signing it. Honestly I think it's hilarious that you are trying to twist it around and act like there isn't a massive arrogance in the way you sing that song and trying yo change it into something that even most England fans dont believe it to be, a song about failure. There's no way they are taking the piss out therselves by singing it like it's a parody or something. Most fans and pundits as I said say its coming home when they think England can/will win, simple as that. Go watch the pre final build up guarantee its all ""were gonna do it, its coming home"" usual English arrogance and zero irony",2021-07-13 19:26:49

It's sung as a kind of parody and taking the mickey out of ourselves (something the English love to do) and certainly not a statement of fact.

It's a bit like when a 4th tier team recently got promoted and sang ""4 years time we'll win the champions league"", they don't actually expect to do it but are just having a laugh.  The Irish have a similar sense of humour to us and borrowed a club song in 1990 to sing ""we're going to shake them up when we win the world cup as we're the world's greatest football team"", they weren't being arrogant claiming to be the world's best team they were having a laugh and it's the same when singing it's coming home.  Almost every team in England (and Scotland) sings that they're ""the greatest football team the world has ever seen"" but Grimsby town don't really think that they're better than real madrid it's just their humour.

I bet there were many English ashamed of seeing such actions, but ultimately, that was the image they were projecting. Only thing I can say is that there were slightly fewer boos for the kneeling as the tournament progressed, compared to the start. I imagine if Hungary would have hosted the last matches instead, we'd feel the same outrage and disgust at their racist and homophobic slurs.

>It's still probably too early to be able to identity and localize the thousands of messages of abuse sent to the players.

It is, but I assume of the ones they have identified so far the majority have been from overseas. I have no reason to believe Gareth Southgate would 'cover' for England fans. He's been very willing to criticise England fans where he feels it's appropriate, for example about taking the knee.

>Look, saying that other countries have issues with racism (which is true) to detract from your own country's issues will just make matters worse. England has a problem. It's a fact.

England has a problem, but most other countries in Europe have far bigger problems and yet people only seem concerned about the problem in England. Doesn't that strike you as a bit odd? Why did people seem several orders of magnitude more outraged when England fans booed a national anthem than they did when Italian fans did booed a national anthem and did Nazi salutes and Nazi chants in Israel, for example?

Don't you think it's possible that at least part of the backlash against England is xenophobic, or dare I even say racist in nature?",2021-07-13 13:20:56

Southgate's quote literally is: ""I know a lot has come from abroad. People who track those things have been able to explain that. But not all of it."" This isn't really saying much in terms of receiving abuse or not from the English, but it sounds more like a way to put the fire out. No numbers, no stats. It's still probably too early to be able to identity and localize the thousands of messages of abuse sent to the players.

Look, saying that other countries have issues with racism (which is true) to detract from your own country's issues will just make matters worse. England has a problem. It's a fact. If the same people who criticized taking the knee saying it's gesture politics now condemn the same actions that taking the knee was trying to highlight, it tells us we have a lot of work to do still.

Comment,1,h4zmzh4,,0,1626169336.0,"So when Southgate said the majority of the abuse has already been identified as coming from abroad you thought he was lying about that? 

The Germans literally made a crying Brazilian kid a meme, far harsher than the English fans laughing at one briefly. It would have been forgotten about the next day if people hadn't decided to use it as a a stick to beat England with.

Almost every team boos national anthems. Denmark, Germany and Italy all do it all the time. Italian fans a couple of years ago not only booed the Israeli national anthem but were doing Nazi salutes and Nazi chants during the entire game.

I can't even remember hearing about a laser being aimed at players in the UK before this incident, but I've seen it numerous times in other countries.

It’s a similar sentiment, even if you like one because it was against English fans (who deserved some comeuppance) and dislike the other because it was against Italian fans. No one was taking the high road, which is fine.

And I’ll say it again in case my words are misconstrued - English fans were horrendous this tournament and did not deserve to see their team and staff, who are all outstanding men and women, win the tournament. With that said, the English team and staff deserve incredible praise for what they have achieved both on and off the field. Same goes for the Italian team for that matter",2021-07-13 12:39:22

And I will say - YES THE ENGLISH FAN BASE ACTED LIKE PRICKS AND DESERVE SOME COMEUPPANCE. I’m English and do feel compelled to acknowledge what shitheads our fans have been.

England also basically just used their “home tournament” turn without actually getting all of the matches at home, which actually kind of sucks. I’d rather not have hosted the semi final and final this year and had a chance to host one of the next five euros where one country will host ALL of the games, which England will not have the chance to do because they got the semi final and final of this tournament.

This isn't the Olympics. A silver medal in football does not hold the same prestige as in Olympic sports. Imagine your most gut-wrenching loss taking place (as it will have been for most of those young lads). Now imagine it taking place in front of 60,000 + in attendance and millions watching at home.

If grace and manners are so important, why aren’t people blasting chiellini for holding back and dragging saka to the ground, preventing him from running onto goal? The answer is because sport on this level has nothing to do with manners nor grace. Never has been, never will be, never should be. The fans left for many reasons, including travel reasons (London at night is a nightmare), COVID protocols, and because it is unbearably painful to watch your side lose a final after 55 years not reaching a final. Again, no Italian fan nor player would care that they left early, because everyone who knows and lives football knows how painful it is. There’s your grace for you; them not caring to see losing fans suffer a trophy presentation. 

Violating humanity is where the line is drawn, and aside from that, everything else is about winning or losing. Every single player last night would say the same, as evidenced by the diving, tactical fouls, etc by both teams.

I don't know how you could have possibly found any whataboutism there, because at no point did I say or imply ""what about...?"" My point what you're lumping together very different levels of poor behaviour. Just because a lot of people booed it doesn't mean a lot of people are guilty of the bad behaviour that actually matters.

>Alright, so English people are so deranged that you can't reason with them without starting a fight is what you're saying? That doesn't really make them look any better.

I don't know how you could have managed to type all of that without realising that it makes no sense. I'm saying *one person* or a *small group of people,* the kind of people who would shine a laser pointer in people's eyes, are obviously not going to be reasoned with. Do you honestly think that's the same thing as ""Engish people are deranged""?

>But if it's a group of drunk friends as you say, do you really think they would've been able to remain quiet about it? Nah.

I don't see why not. I would guess most people were paying more attention to the match. But ""drunk and rowdy group"" and ""hiding the laser pointer"" were two separate explanations that don't need to go together. It could have been a drunk group that no one wanted to get involved with. It could have been one quiet person not drawing attention to it.

>No. Moaning about a blatant dive that leads to an illegitimate goal is not silly. The fact that you hold this opinion indirectly says that you really don't watch football.

You said ""The **luck** of having home advantage in all matches but one."" That's what I mean when I refer to luck.

I wouldn't be so arrogant as to assume something like ""you don't watch football"" but if you think going down at the lightest touch isn't extremely common, maybe you haven't been paying much attention.

>It's frustrating since this would be a 'pan-European' tournament, but England still get to play six out of seven matches at home. Yes, it's not England's fault. But that doesn't mean people can't criticise the way it is.

By all means criticise it, just don't use it as part of an argument for why it would have been a ""disgrace"" for England to have won.

>Also, London is literally the only venue that doesn't allow away fans.

Wembley did allow away fans. The issue is that many countries, including host countries, have restrictions on travel and require things like quarantine. If some didn't, that's irresponsibility, not a standard to hold others to.

>A family that lives in England will support England in a Euro final. What a crazy revelation. They can hold that opinion if a want, but to claim it means everyone else also should is just idiotic.

That's not what I said. I don't expect anyone to *support* England, I expect them to understand the basic principle that the actions of a minority do not condemn the majority.",2021-07-13 01:43:11

Comment,6,h4ytx3s,,0,1626125683.0,"I'm really not twisting it. The intention behind it is exactly how I outlined it. Just because you don't understand the cultural reference doesn't make it mean what you believe it does. 

I don't know what your first language is, but you're interpreting it too literally. You're right if you think it means 'we're going to win', but it's more nuanced than that as it is said in hope. It's like buying a lottery ticket and saying I can feel today is my lucky day and I'm going to win. Nobody can know they're going to win the lottery but those words could be said in hope.

The part about it coming home originally meant that the tournament was going to be held in the UK in 1996, but it has somewhat morphed to generally just mean to bring the trophy home, aka where we live.

People have been singing it for 25 years and not a single trophy has come home. They'll be singing it next year in Qatar and probably in many more tournaments to come. I don't know what anyone can say to change your mind.

Comment,2,h520n5e,,0,1626224392.0,"They did have a good run up until the point they failed. At that point all the effort was for nothing. People pay money to go to matches to be entertained. England lost so the entertainment is over and there is no longer any point in staying. It's cruel. I'm not saying it's the way it should be, but that's the way it is. You either win and it's tea and medals, or you lose and you're another England team that hasn't had success. 

Some people will feel differently of course, but it's telling that we don't have a return heroes parade for the team after getting knocked out like some nations do. Some nations will think that's crazy and an offence to the players that tried their best, but it's the way it is here and the manager and players know this before agreeing to play for England. They know the media will crucify them for anything other than a win. Some of the newspapers will put a front page on saying how they're proud of them but it falls on a disinterested public. I think a lot of the criticism of their performance has been avoided due to the horrible racism that has been directed at black players being the main story.

The team failed to capitalise on an early lead and sat back and watched Italy take them apart whilst trying to hold on for a penalty shootout that they know probably won't go their way. That is what will be remembered, not all the good they did in earlier games.

It's important to remember that Gareth and all the team earn millions of pounds to carry that burden so don't feel too sorry for them (except for the racism of course). They'll be fine.",2021-07-14 03:59:52

Comment,1,h51i417,,0,1626216167.0,"I'd argue the citizens of most nations don't understand international relations. 44% of NI voted to leave, so a not insignificant proportion of people living on the island of Ireland were complicit in driving that wedge. The blame can't land entirely on England. It's the politicians who have the responsibility during the Brexit vote of informing the public on the implications of leave or remain and they won't relay that information unless it's politically advantageous for them to do so. At an international level, all nations act on self-interest. It's dispassionate and cold, but that's the only true level playing field. 

I don't like this idea that only the English are susceptible to political manipulation either domestic in origin or foreign, and that all other nations are superior in intellect. These are dangerous times and Brexit is probably just one of the first high-profile casualties of the modern information age along with Trumpism and a resurgent far-right across many, many nations. There will be many more to come across the globe.

My 'why would they care' statement was undoubtedly a bit strong, but to see people on here say the English got what they deserved because of a vote they were given is insulting and makes it sound like A) all English voted to leave, and B) those that did are inherently stupid and did it solely to piss off the rest of the EU. There were many reasons people voted to leave and as much as I don't agree with them, they have the right to vote how they see fit. I think they've been manipulated, but they'd probably say the same about me.

The Italian fans haven't acted just as racist, they have reacted vastly more racist and have done so at virtually every tournament and match they have been in for decades, as well as in their domestic league. Italy has an absolutely gigantic problem with racism and its authorities do nothing to stop it. England has a far smaller problem with racism and our authorities punish people who take part in it. England is a model of how other countries should deal with racism.

If Bonucci played for England and had made the same racist comments, he probably never would have played for the national team again, yet he was there for Italy to score their crucial equalising goal because Italy doesn't do anything to stop racism. The black player he made the comment towards was left at home, in fact, most of Italy's few high profile black players have been hounded out of their team by years of racist abuse and a lack of support from the authorities. https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/teams/66--italy/squad/ Not many black faces in this line up here.

>The hate is not based on being English, it's based on being a cunt

Yet people completely ignore Nazi chanting by the other teams that goes on for literally decades but hate England for booing an anthem in a couple of matches like every other team does. Certainly can't be based on fan behaviour because English fans are nothing compared to other fans.

>THIS tournament

So you exclusively want to talk about this tournament? German fans booed the Hungarian anthem in Germany but then in their next game against England in England their own anthem was booed and everyone was terribly outraged. The Danish booed the Finnish anthem in Denmark, then got booed in England, and everyone was outraged. Due to COVID home fans greatly outnumbered away fans so naturally, the English fans were louder because they were more numerous, but in games played in other countries, the home fans have booed anthems, because that's what fans do. I wouldn't do it, but fans of every country seem to. If the final had been held in Rome, and if there were no COVID travel restrictions, it's likely there would have been dozens of England fans stabbed because in addition to being incredibly racist Italian fans are also incredibly violent.

Why don't you see there's a problem with people ignoring racism by an all-white team and fan base for decades but then absolutely piling on a multi-ethnic team and fan base for a few relatively minor incidents?",2021-07-13 17:13:46

The medal for second place is treated as a loser medal but they fail to look at the bigger picture, which is that they even made it to the finals in the first place. Of course they lost the single most important match of the tournament, but not appreciating/celebrating second place pretty much deems all of their hard work up to that point worthless. I know how the tournament system is flawed in that sense, but even taking part in the final match is an achievement in itself and should be considered as such.

It's got nothing to do with being dumb, I've seen German comedians with German friends without laughing at all but that doesn't mean I'm dumb, it's just a different culture and a different sense of humour. I can see you're Italian (or an Italian fan at any rate) and I can tell you I went to Italy in 2019 and met some lovely people who sang 'its coming home' to us, they were asking me why the English are so confident of winning when we never win anything, I tried explaining we're not confident at all we just say it ironically. I don't think they got it, but there's my proof that mainland Europe has a different sense of humour.

But anyway the boos were not an example of humour, but it's not like it's anything new, the Danish booed the Finnish national anthem for example. Scots booed the English one. Hungary booed every national anthem. The Italians booed the Welsh (and that was in a nothing game where Italy had already qualified so get off your high horse).

In fact, from every game I remembered watching, whenever there were significantly more of one countries fans than the other i.e when they're at home, there was booing during the national anthems.

You could just hear the English ones so well because there were more fans, especially as the tournament went on when Wembley was able to allow more fans. In Hungary for example, when they were allowed 100% capacity, you can hear booing in the anthems.

To be honest, I'm not even against booing anthems, it creates a bit of an atmosphere, some might see it as disrespectful and I can see where they're coming from, but to me, I don't take it too personally.",2021-07-13 15:35:01

Yes, it is a minority but a sizable one and saying it's a minority and going ""all right then"", that's falling into a trap we don't want to be.

I have met thuggish football fans and wannabe hooligans and they are, without doubt, the most pathetic bunch of individuals I have ever come across. Utterly pathetic. It would be bad enough if it were all 18 year old idiots with more testosterone than brain-cells at that point as they get out of their teenage years but a sizable proportion are so-called ""grown men"" in their fifties, with families, who behave like small children whenever something goes against their team - or even when it doesn't. It's utterly embarrassing, pathetic and humiliating and these people deserve to be degraded for their behaviour rather than ""feared"".

The younger ""thugs"" seem to look up to them and follow them and it's embarrassing.

We need to stop indulging this behaviour because I've seen it too often. People in pubs, for example, who are completely embarrassing themselves. Screaming abuse at other countries or other clubs, psychotically howling and screaming incoherently in rage at an opposition player just for being there, jumping on tables screaming ""ten German bombers"", threatening violence on anyone that doesn't support your team, making it a horrible experience for everyone else, the abuse women get who don't simper at their stupidity is appalling.

But from some, you just get ""oh, lads will be lads"", ""they work hard, they need to let off some steam, they're harmless"", ""working-class boys"" and ""they're the life and soul of the country"". No. No more of this pathetic indulging. It encourages them and makes them go further. They are children in the bodies of adults and should be treated as such. Call these people out, make it known they're not welcome if they behave like that. I'm anti offence culture but no indulging jokes about ""smacking the missus if we lose, she'd better prepare!"".

We aren't going to get on top of this by indulging them and encouraging them to escalate. It is a minority but we need to start getting on top of it now, it's gone on long enough.",2021-07-13 14:41:18

You're right that the phrase ""it's coming home"" is used as a tongue in cheek slang for we as re optimistic that we will win it, but the song its self being sung doesn't have that connotation. 

I also thing subtlety of language is lost - when I say ""I'm going home"" it doesn't mean I have the only home, but I'm going to my home - similarly it's coming home is saying ""it's coming home with us"" rather than the trophy belongs to us.

I know. What's your point? The song is still about England winning.

>Anyway, the song isn't about winning, 

The lyrics literally describe how talented the English team is and how the narrator believes England will win. 

Just because 'coming home' is referring to the fact that the contest was in England doesn't mean that it wasn't sung with the sentiment that it was going to be England's year. The fact that the song refers to football coming to England as 'coming home' should be telling enough on its own.",2021-07-13 21:29:07

I don't expect you understand, since history says you are not used to reach many finals but trust me..... usually that happens.

Italy lost many finals on penalties.....It hurts more, but It Is the same victory.....

And I mean, yes, it’s part of the game, but when you talk with someone, and they only answer with “cope” or “cry more” because they wanna troll instead of havjng a discussion, you understand we start getting heated. In Italy we make fun when players do shit like Chiellini or Immobile, and there were fans calling for Immobile not to play after that.

Comment,3,h52dpoa,,0,1626201356.0,"😂 Nice to meet you too. Great game on Sunday. I'm of course disappointed England didn't win, but Italy had them on the back foot for most of the game and the penalty takers for England were poor choices. That's how it goes though. Italy played better and the result reflected that.

 People on Reddit seem to be very sensitive about professional fouls or diving but to me it's all part of the game. Italy have that winning mentality and I like to see that from England too. Immobile's miraculous recovery in the box had me in stitches laughing and applauding. Whether or not Sterling went down deliberately or not, he won the pen and did what had to be done. It's fair because they all do it.

From what I can tell it's Kane's job to get in the box and fall over but he overdid it a bit and the ref was having none of it lol.",2021-07-13 21:35:56

I'm 21 years old and from the UK.

If I am being honest I have never really been into football before however seeing us come this far in the Euros really got me into it.

&#x200B;

I'm here to ask genuine football fans a question on how we played in our last game. No hate from different supports please just answer genuinely. I know we lost and fair play to Italy I just want to learn more so I'm ready for the world cup next year!

&#x200B;

General Football Questions Below:

1. Do players know they are the ones taking penalties before the game starts?
2. Do players have a choice?
3. Can players who have been substituted earlier in the game take penalties? 
4. Are goalies expected to save penalties? or does everyone assume the ball is going in?

England vs Italy Game specific Question Below:

1. Why Saka? He's only 19 that's a lot of pressure to put on a young lad.

Would love to hear all your thoughts. Again no hate from anyone please the players played there best and hopefully it will come home in the World Cup next year!",2021-07-14 12:34:25

Postcard from Rome,11,ojczlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/ojczlj/postcard_from_rome/,1,1626172969.0,"
My dear English fans,

I know is not a great moment for ya’ll, but I hope to find you better than yesterday.

I landed 24hs ago in Rome. 
Here, the weather is great, the vibes are wonderful, and since my arrival I’ve only seen happy people around me.
IT’S AWESOME!

This is not my first trip to Italy.
It’s my sixth time here, the very first one dating back to 1934, and you know what?
Despite me getting older and older, they always welcome me with more and more passion. Can you believe it?! 

But they’re not the only one, no way!
I’ve traveled a lot around the world.
Besides Italy, my top picks have been Brazil, and Germany: very different countries, but they have their own ways to make me feel special!
To be fair, I’ve felt loved wherever I went, and it’s a long list: Uruguay, France, Argentina, Spain, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Soviet Union, Holland, Portugal, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Denmark.

Some places I visited once, some others more than that, but they still love me.
Some places have now different names, some others not, but they still love me.

And I love them back, ‘cause it’s true: you always leave something behind in the places you have been.
I’ll never forget them, and I’m sure they’ll never forget me.
WHAT AN AWESOME TRIP I’M HAVING!

And what about you?
“Yeah buddy, we haven’t seen you around since 1966..WTF?!”
I know, it’s a long time. Beatles were the new big thing, Liverpool just won its 7th title, and Armstrong had not yet mooned.
It seems like ages ago!

I know you miss me. I know you love me, and believe me I love you back!
I know you would love for me to come back, and I’ll probably do it, sooner or later.

I’ll always be glad you gave me birth, but as for now…

DON’T TAKE ME HOME
PLEASE DON’T TAKE ME HOME
I JUST DON’T WANNA GO TO WORK
I WANNA STAY HERE DRINKING ALL THE BEER
PLESE DON’T, PLEASE DON’T TAKE ME HOME

From Rome,
Your ever loving Football",2021-07-13 13:42:49

An England fan’s perspective on England’s Euro 2020,122,oiqfxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/oiqfxy/an_england_fans_perspective_on_englands_euro_2020/,61,1626093618.0,"This will take about 3 minutes and 20 seconds to read.

To start things off, I have to say a massive congratulations to Italy for winning the Euros and thank you to the fans of all nationalities making this a tournament to remember, and I can’t wait to see England play against you (and obviously beat you ;) ) again.

I couldn’t be more proud of England for achieving their first international final in 55 years, and considering the team’s youth and the challenges some of these players have faced on and off the pitch, it’s incredibly impressive to see them do so well. While disappointing that we lost, I saw a different kind of victory at the end of the tournament in that we saw the potential these players have and how England can really shine in the future, and considering how well England have done throughout Euro 2020, I really don’t have many complaints about how we performed.

As for Gareth Southgate, he’s a hero. A World Cup semi-final and a Euro final in his first two international competitions really brings me hope, along with the young players’ yet-to-be-achieved potential, that England can consistently achieve greatness. I couldn’t be any happier to see Gareth Southgate stay as manager of England as he’s proven that he’s absolutely capable of success.

Unfortunately at this point, I can’t really focus on the positives anymore, and these things are really the whole reason that I wanted to make this post.

England fans. People say it’s a small minority of England fans behaving horrendously but it seems to me like there’s a big enough minority to be concerned about, and really, it makes me feel horrible to be associated with the likes of them. They are the complete opposite of what the England footballers stand for. 

Booing national anthems, increasing domestic abuse incidents after England games, beating up innocent people because you have the emotional maturity of a three-year-old, racially abusing players, trying to blind Kasper Schmeichel, making fun of a little girl for crying, I could go on. Your behaviour is egregious.

To everybody saying ‘keep politics out of football’, I can’t really side with you. Because football’s so widespread among communities, it’s hard for people to avoid ‘politics’. Football is for everyone, so to shut people down over human rights (not political btw) such as BLM, LGBTQ+ and feeding children is downright ignorant and denies people the opportunity to feel comfortable playing the beautiful game, and you need to have a word with yourself if you do make these points.

The reason I bring this up is because there’s a lot of this in football, including from England fans. Once again, this uncompassionate behaviour is against all that the England players and, quite frankly, any decent person, would stand for.

Lastly, the England players taking the silver medals off immediately after receiving them is ungrateful in my eyes. I know I’ve been saying that England’s got huge potential and all that but this is football; anything’s possible, including our highest finish from now on being a silver medal.

To conclude, I have immense pride for this England side over the course of the last month, however I really wish that the rest of England would act with a lot more compassion towards others. I’m a very proud England football team fan, but with how England fans behave and how it aligns with the political landscape of England itself, I can’t say I have any pride in being English. I do believe, though, that football can be a catalyst for ‘political’ change, and one day, we won’t have to deal with such terrible behaviour.

I hope I’ve explained my views well enough, but if I haven’t, feel free to say something about it. If you’ve made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to hear my thoughts on our performance and behaviour on and off the pitch, and once again a huge congratulations to Italy and thank you to everyone involved. Take care :)",2021-07-12 15:40:18

Group A. Turkey v Italy
Group B. Russia v Denmark
Group C. Netherlands v Ukraine
Group D. Croatia v Scotland 
Group E. Sweden v Poland
Group F. Germany v Hungary
Round of 16: Croatia v Spain
Quarter-Finals: Ukraine v England
Semi-finals: Italy v Spain

Football was said to be coming home to the country in which association football was created. There are many iterations of football but association football is what we all know as football/soccer today.

The lyrics to the song are about the heartbreak that is supporting the English national team, which has never been in a final since 1966 when they won the world cup and has been knocked out of every tournament since in a heartbreaking fashion for English fans. Football is England's national sport and means a lot to a lot of people.

The phrase 'It's coming home' is taken from this song and has been adopted by English fans as a song of hope that we can do better this tournament and finally have some success.

It seems to be taken by people on here as some arrogant message that England owns football or the trophy which is simply not true.

Keep hating on England for getting excited about being in a final but also understand that you have missed the point of the phrase.

* England had a pretty easy round to the finals and by far no perfect record in the groups. 
   * Germany was incredibly week and barely made it out of the group stages.
   * Denmark was a strong team, but given they are a tiny country with a pool of 1/10th the population of England. Yet they have still given them a real run for their late victory and during times seemed to be in control of the game.

I was as bummed out as any upon that loss to England after we got so close to a penalty shootout. At the same time, I never expected Denmark to be able to challenge England as much as they did—and even on Wembley with 55k roaring English supporters. Very proud of this bunch and the best campaign performance I've seen from a Danish team in my 33 year life.

Would have *never* expected this after that first game, losing to Finland—who we should have beat comfortably—and losing our best player and talisman in such a traumatic fashion. Everyone I watched the game with were saying ""Oh well, that's it. Maybe next time."" We were just happy to find out that Christian survived.

The turnaround in the later stages of the tournament was something magical that I'll never forget as a fan of football and Denmark.

**Acceptance is the next stage of grief**

I have to address the penalty decision in the England-match. Having seen the replays from various angles, I'm starting to accept that it may actually have been a (small) penalty. Sterling was hit on the knee and bumped on the hip. Those were very slight touches, but admittedly enough to get a player out of balance.

Add to that, England *did* deserve to win. They drew energy from the crowd and we looked incredibly tired. Hjulmand subbing out Dolberg and Damsgaard really killed it for us, but according to Hjulmand there was no choice... they were too tired to continue.

Would much rather suffer a deserved defeat than losing after dominating, like it happened in the Finland-match. So it doesn't feel all too bitter.

**The future for the Danish team**

Eriksen tragic accident was luckily not all for nothing. We got to see Damsgaard really shine. A player in the margins who would've probably not had a lot of minutes otherwise. I can't wait to see how Hjulmand will structure the Danish team around a new core of Damsgaard, Mæhle, Højbjerg and Christensen. Kjær is old but Joachim Andersen is waiting. If Dolberg can start to become more consistent in his club performances, perhaps we've also got our biggest problem—the striker position—solved as well. And who knows if Eriksen will be able to come back, but Eriksen next to Damsgaard would make for some buttery smooth attacking play!

**The final**

Admittedly, I'll be cheering for Italy in the final. That's not because England beat us, but merely because I'm dead tired of the incessant *It's coming home* chant. Italy will struggle on Wembley with the crowd against them, and I tend to cheer for the underdog (which Italy is, according to the bookmakers). But heck, won't be mad if England wins it either after all these years of heartache.

In conclusion, what a tournament it has been! So many high-scoring matches, extra times, penalty shootouts, dramatic circumstances, this EUROs truly has not disappointed. Can't wait for the World Cup!",2021-07-09 11:58:14

I just wanted to get a few things off my chest

First things first, everyone that is against England and hates the England team don't take your hatred out on them as they just play them same as every other team, they want to win and make their country proud! I understand about the controversial moments but unfortunately that happens in so many games and other teams but it seems they don't get the hate like England does.

I also want to point out that as an England fan I know and despise the horrid hooligans within the English fans that boo and do horrible shit like the laser pointer incident because it just brings down the reputation of the fans and the team! I honestly wish they'd piss off because it does ruin my excitement and happiness of winning these games. 

Basically I just want all the other fans of every of nation to know that us English fans aren't all wankers, majority are literally happy to win a game like you would with your national team, and there is no harm in a nation to feel passionate about winning!

Anyway, I can't wait for Sunday, I am proper nervous as Italy have been fantastic as well so we shall see!

Oh and don't forget, Italy have also been dodge with their fake injuries and that Denmark corner that shouldn't have been a corner, basically every team had a faith share of shite! So stop being cynical bastard's and lets enjoy this beautiful international football :)

Edit: additional note; let's just enjoy how amazing this euro competition has been no matter the result, considering the shit year we all have been through because of Covid! Every nation has been fantastic and I've loved every game, here's to the World Cup next year!!!",2021-07-08 05:59:49

"The ""offensive"" bias in football.",13,ofm9kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/ofm9kp/the_offensive_bias_in_football/,7,1625674820.0,"The opinions on yesterday's match pretty much agree: Spain played better, Italy got lucky and risked the elimination for the first time in the tournament. Spain deserved more. I'm italian, and even among my fellow italians that opinion is really common. ""We got lucky, but that's ok, sometimes you get a win that you didn't really deserve, what we deserved is to be here through the tournament as a whole but yesterday was our lucky day"". Stuff like that. Just because for the first time Italy wasn't the one establishing the rhythm and having more possession of the ball. Well, I disagree, and I will explain why (and no, it isn't because I'm Italian, I swear). Football isn't just about attacking, but also about defending. Think of the famous dilemma ""What's stronger, an unstoppable strenght or an unmovable object?"". Unlike other sports like basketball (where the players who attack are also the same players that defend), football has specific roles in each position of the field: players of course can move, and it isn't that rare for a defender to score or make an assist, nor it's crazy for a forward to defend when needed. But this distinction is still pretty defining of what a player can do in its role. Roles, of course, do exist in basketball too, but it's not about field position: you don't have ""attackers"" and ""defenders"". All players are both of those things, they just do their jobs differently (with the playmaker being the source of assists, for example, and the center being the big dude whose role is to stay close to the net and try to score from close distance. Wings are good at shots from the distance and such). But the same Center that dunked 30 seconds ago will be the defender against the opposing Center when the other team is attacking. Which is why in basketball, you will almost never hear ""we got lucky and won even though we didn't deserve it"": the team that wins is the one that BOTH attacked better and defended better: as simple/obvious as it may seem, they scored more than the opponent, and they had the opponent score less than them (duh!).

In football the situation is pretty different: where in basketball there's always a 5vs5 scenario, in football you could say that the ""opponent"" of the defenders are the forwards (whose role is to score), the ""opponent"" of the forwards are the defenders (who must prevent them from scoring), while the midfielders are against each other. Forwards won't interact that much with the forwards of the opposing team, and in the same way the defenders won't interact that much with the defenders of the other side. Of course it can happen (example: a corner kick with the defenders of the attacking side going forward to try to score with a header) but MOST of the match is between the forwards of the attacking side and the defenders of the defending side, or alternatively in a midfield vs midfield scenario. Again, I'm really dumbing it down just to make a point, of course it's more complex than that.

It's pretty easy and straightforward to say that the side with more ball possession is the one that spends more time attacking. That, of course, mean that the side with less ball possession spends more time defending.

Now, let's imagine, just in theory, a match with a 100% vs 0% ball possession that ends 0-0. I'm pretty sure that most would argue that the side with 100% ball possession played better than the other side.And here's the point I wanted to make: honestly, I disagree. I think that football discourse has kind of an ""offensive bias"". Good attacking is way more appreciated than good defending.If in that fictional match I described earlier the result was 0-0, it means that even though a side attacked pretty much all the time, the defense of the side with 0% ball possession never conceded a goal. Of course, with 0% ball possession you can't possibly score, I'm not saying that it's a good strategy to win. I'm just saying that I wouldn't think ""the side with the most ball possession played better, they attacked all the time"", because if anything, that proves that the other side had a rock solid defense that didn't concede a single goal DESPITE their opponents relentlessly attacking for the whole match. The ones that failed in achieving their goal (which is scoring) are the forwards of the attacking side, while the ones that succeeded in NOT letting the other side score are the defenders of the team that had 0% ball possession. Why should I consider one team ""more deserving"" than the other? Isn't keeping a clean sheet a huge merit of the team that never had ball possession? Of course, I'm not saying they deserve to win: while their defense would make Italy's defense look like the one of San Marino... their midfielders/forwards were terrible and were never dangerous. That, though, also means that the defense of the side that attacked for the whole match has almost no merits in getting  a clean sheet: they just did because the other side never attacked.

Now, this is an absurd scenario, that will never happen. It's a concept taken to the extreme. But while 0-100 ball possession is impossible, Barcelona isn't new to losing matches where they had an embarrassing ""advantage"" if you look at ball possession and ""establishing the rhythm of the game"". In 2013/14, they lost 2-1 to Glasgow Celtic with 89% (!!!) against Celtic's 11%. Why would I ever say that Barça ""deserved"" to win? Their defense conceded more goals despite being under attack way less. Their offense scored less goals despite attacking way more. With that reasoning, you could actually say that Celtic played way better! With a defense that conceded just one goal despite being under attack all the time, and an attack that scored twice despite barely touching the ball. Why should a relentless attack should be more impressive than a rock solid defense? To me, it isn't. Not conceding 3 goals is better than scoring 2. Of course, I'm not arguing ""defense is actually more important"": if you don't score, maybe you don't lose but you also don't win.

What I'm saying is that they're equally important. Yesterday's match wasn't our fictional 0-100 match, nor was Barça-Celtic. 1-1 was a fair result: yes, Spain had the rhythm of the game in their hands (or, should I say feet?), but Italy's defense was almost perfect and made one single mistake when Morata scored. I was never afraid of us going down, everything they did was shut down by the italian defenders and defending midfielders. That is a merit, just as much as relentlessly attacking. And Spain's defense looked way less solid, despite Italy having fewer occasions.

Italy had a better defense. Spain had a better attack.

Italy had a worse attack. Spain had a worse defense.

(with ""attack"", I mean the attacking phase in general, so even the midfielders, when in possession of the ball.)

If Spain had a better defense, they would have won by keeping a clean sheet. If Italy had a better attack, they would have won by scoring 1 or 2 more goals.

Why would I say that one side deserved more than the other? The draw was a fair result, and in a ""national championship"" environment, 1 point to both teams would be the ideal scenario. Of course knock-out tournaments don't work like that and we won the penalty shootout.

But I don't think we got lucky at all. We have a rock solid defense, one of the best goalkeepers in the world, and that's our merit, not our luck.",2021-07-07 19:20:20

&#x200B;

Wondering who people think will take this home?

&#x200B;

Donnarumma is currently favourite, but people still seem to assume Pedri is a shoo-in after last night's unreal performance. Whilst I agree he's probably been more impressive, but can a player not in the final win it.

&#x200B;

Obviously a lot will rely on what happens in the final, but should Italy lose, could Donnarumma still win it??

A lot of ifs and buts remain. Should England get there, and win, would Rice win it, assuming a non-stand out performance from him/Gigi. When is it presented, after the final? If it was chosen to be Pedri, would it get presented Saturday? So many questions.

I was ready to just mess around for 90 minutes, maybe have an uneventful 1-0, and go home.

But boy was I in for a treat! The match I went to was France vs Switzerland, and the experience was amazing. The entire stadium errupted when Switzerland scored 2 goals in the last 10 minutes. Also, France almost ended the match at the very last second (right before the whistle), but his the goal post instead. The penalties really had me clenching my cheecks :D

My pal told me that was the only match from this year's Euro that ended in penalites (up until that point), so it seems like I really struck gold with my first football experience. I just felt like I had to share. I made a [vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvlDlwtBN20) out of the whole thing as well.

I really enjoyed my time, and am thinking of going to more games.

(Don't say it's impossible - We have seen these miracles like Leicester City-Premier league 2016, Atletico Madrid-Champions league 2014, Greece-EUROs 2004, Denmark-EUROs 1992, Liverpool-Barcelona comback, PSG-Barcelona comeback, AC Milan-Liverpool comeback, Nottingham Forest-1979/1980, SD Eibar-Cinderella Story, Hand of God and more and more and more).
And this was only SOME of the Football miracales. I didn't add individual performances/miracles. + other sports have also these storys.

So yeah, I'm not going to say that it's going to happen 100% but im pretty sure that this possibility is high enough to believe in it with cool head.
Im not usually Denmark fan, but this tournament i said to my friends and family before it began that Denmark will win it, i feel it.

People are underestimating Spain!,10,odjaw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/odjaw5/people_are_underestimating_spain/,36,1625400976.0,"Lemme, make this clear, I know that Spain has messed up a lot of times in the tournament, and a lot of people think that they have gotten lucky to have gotten so far. I disagree. The reason why they got so far is that they fixed what they messed up.

**Group Stages**  
Spain failed to take a lead in both matches against Sweden and Poland. They messed up. But in the match against Slovakia, they *fixed what they messed up*, and won 5-0

**Round of 16 (Spain vs Croatia)**  
WHAT A MATCH!!!! But, Spain started with an embarrassing own goal. I remember seeing the morale of the Spanish player go down. But guess what they handled *the pressure* extremely well. They *fixed what they messed up*, and Scored 3 goals, taking a huge lead.  
But then, the Spanish defence messed up, and Croatia caught up. Now, imagine the kind of pressure the Spanish players would have been under then. A match, they were winning, suddenly slipping out of their hands. Spain *learnt from their mistakes,* and yet again, fought *the pressure*, *fixed what they messed up*, and won 5-3

**Quarter-Finals (Spain vs Switzerland)**  
Spain got off to a good start, scoring a goal in the first 10 minutes, due to an unlucky mistake by the Swiss. It was a modest match. Switzerland scored tieing the score. The Spanish team failed to score a goal. As many people online described it, ""The inability of the Spanish attackers to score a goal""  
In the extra time, Spain pushed very hard. They made so many attempts to score a goal. But Sommer (Swiss goalkeeper) was extremely good. I still remember, many people online were sure that Switzerland would win in the penalty kicks like with France. I bet, Spain too felt the same because of how many times Sommer denied them a goal in the match. Again, Spain was under a ton of pressure. They overcame *that pressure*, again winning the game.

Spain has a huge advantage because they have faced so much pressure throughout the tournament, that the players are ready for anything, and they will do their best to fix whatever they mess up.

Also, you must understand that Spain has a huge advantage in the semi-final and Italy, because Italy, essentially copies, the Spanish game.  
It will be very difficult for Italy to beat Spain at their own game.

Also FYI 

As someone who currently lives in England  - I have watched every single England game, and rooted for them.

A Scandinavian bar in London is where we have been watching most of the Denmark games - as Danes will go there and it’s a nice little corner we have. Because the England game was happening later the bar was about 50/50 Danish - English. Even they could have literally gone to any other bar…

During the Danish national anthem the English in the bar booed over us singing. It fucking ruined the atmosphere. Small man syndrome or something. This would never fucking happen in Denmark.

A friend and I were both wearing Danish jerseys, got “booed” walking down the street, got screamed at in the tube “it’s coming home” by people standing right next to us.

It is based on Elo rating. I used all 42369 ever played international matches. ([Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017)). I optimized the parameters of the Elo rating to give the best predictions. Using these Elo rating I can calculate the probability for each match. In the Euro 2020 there are 7 matches remaining, resulting in 2\^7=128 scenario's. Each scenario has a probability. (2 matches have been played, so the winner is 100% certain).

Also was the best match in EURO 2020. I hope Italy will be a champion cause they are deserved it. If Belgium has won I would say same thing. Ukraine and Czech Republic are sympathetic teams. Denmark is a very good team and probably everyone like them. The others have very bad footballs. Spain was very lucky these matches. They are not playing anything. I'm sorry but this is the truth.

Update after elimination of Denmark. 

So far based on these probabilities (from QF onwards) using MLE you would be 100% accurate in predicting the winner.
(Note this is possibly English biased as it is based on English bookies.)

A simple method to calculating winning probabilities of each country. The method is to use betting companies odds as probabilities. Betting companies have to make money so their estimation better be right. 

For those interested in how it is computed please see https://www.kaggle.com/garyongguanjie/euro2020. 
Data is scraped from here https://www.oddschecker.com/football/euro-2020/winner.
The math is simple we take the average/median odds of winning. Then we take the reciprocal divided by it's sum.

The race for Euro 2020 top scorer is typically competitive, with some of the best strikers in the competition fighting it out for the top individual title.

Cristiano Ronaldo currently leads the pack as Euro 2020 top scorer with five goals to his name, the Portugal captain breaking numerous scoring records in the process.

Thoughts on Covid safety at Wembley? What would you do?,1,ob7t5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/ob7t5q/thoughts_on_covid_safety_at_wembley_what_would/,25,1625090892.0,"England fan, have tickets to the second semi next week with family. Before anyone asks I'm not selling any tickets, if anything I'll give mine to another family member/friend.

My wife has made it very clear that she doesn't want me to go in case I catch anything... I'm flying to Asia for her brother's wedding a couple days later (weddings are a massive deal over there in their culture). She's already out there atm.

I'm heavily inclined to just go to this potentially once in a lifetime event. But Wembley looked packed out even at 50% capacity, and just been watching fan videos of reactions inside the stadium - which aren't really helping my case...

Planning on really covering up and being as careful as I can if I go. This is such an awkward and massively disappointing situation...  


Update: What a roller coaster and a massive disappointment. The country I'm flying to (Indonesia) has just increased their hotel quarantine for foreigners from 5 days to 8 days - and as a result I need to bring my flight forward and I will miss the match. Don't even know if I can watch it on the plane. The family dynamics/culture are such that I can't really miss this wedding. Plus they're not overly into sport, so I don't reckon they understand how much this match means, especially for us English. Thank you for all of your thoughts, advice and suggestions - it's meant a lot. Will be selling the ticket to someone I know, before anyone asks aha. ",2021-07-01 01:08:12

"For all fans watching the Euros through ESPN - Can we please bring attention to ESPN that their decision to hire a hockey commentator (Steve Cangialosi) for soccer/football, especially this special tournament, was a terrible decision, and disrespectful to the lustre of this wonderful sport?",18,oaoqom,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/oaoqom/for_all_fans_watching_the_euros_through_espn_can/,13,1625024389.0,"For those that don’t know, Steve Cangialosi is a commentator at the Euro 2020 tournament, who is repulsive at this job because he knows very little, if anything, about the sport, because his main job is to commentate hockey. If you watched the Sweden vs Ukraine R16 Knockout game today on ESPN, or other various games in the group stages, you were subjected to his high pitched, nonsensical screams. If you’re curious then please search the highlights to this game on YouTube. But mind your ears. 

This is taken from two perspectives. The first from a long time fan who is already I. Love with the game and can notice this. Secondly, from a new/potential fan who is trying to learn about the game, who is making decisions to see if this is a sport they want to get into or not - this is mainly ESPN’s target audience. If they can get new fans, they get more profit. 

From the first perspective of a long time fan and follower who is very knowledgeable about the sport, they know this guy sucks and provides no context throughout the game other than screaming “shot”, “goal”, or yelling the name on the back of a player’s shirt. 

From the second perspective of new viewers, I am sorry you had to endure this. If you are trying to learn more about the game or deciding if you like football/soccer now, then please don’t use games that he commentated as your example, because you’ll learn nothing. 

So what makes Steve so bad at this job? Well, what makes a commentator good:
Explains what is happening in the game. 
The reasons for why a team has conceded a goal 
What does it mean when a team plays high press, possession, or well/poor tactically? 
What is the offside rule?
What results in a penalty?
What is VAR? 
How much time is ET?
What is added time and how is it calculated? 
Where a player or manager is from and what club teams he plays on. 
The teams’s history. 

The list goes on, and as fans we expect this in any sport we are watching, not just soccer/football. Steve does not know any of the information listed above. If it wasn’t for his duo, Alejandro Moreno, to provide context on Steve’s blurbs, he would completely lost in the dark. 

In order for ESPN to in tease interest in this sport in North American viewership, they need to show the new viewers what is is about this game that explains why the rest of the world has fallen in love with it for the past century and a half, not the to Americanize it in their own way with an annoying commentator that doesn’t know what he’s spewing on about. 

If you think I’m just saying this because he’s an American commentator, think again. Taylor Twellman is another American commentator for this tournament who duos with Jon Champion and he’s excellent because he can actually provide a thorough context to the list mentioned above. He’s also a former player and a very articulate speaker. He has elaborate and thought provoking conversation with Jon that is very enjoyable to watch and give input on, while they debate or agree with many game decisions. Same with Phil Schoen and Ray Hudson who commentate for Bein Sport in LaLiga. They are an iconic duo who know a lot about the game. Really most British commentators or former players can do 

With all the funds and connections ESPN has, I’m shocked they couldn’t find a better host for this position. I hope many more Americans start to follow European Football on the international and club level as well, and for ESPN to do their part in this, they need to replace Steve and hire someone who deserves to be there and actually knows what they’re talking about.",2021-06-30 06:39:49

Czech/Denmark played on 26/27 and will play their next round on Jul 3 but Switzerland/spain played on 28 and will play their next match on Jul 2?

Yes, I know within each pod, they have relatively the same amount of rest for this round, but just the long term fatigue builds up. Why isn't the pod that has Czech/Denmark playing before Spain/Switzerland?

What a match it is, What a match yes the mistake from Unai Simon can Cost them this match but, Spain came back stronger and was dominating midfield untill 68' then a sudden change of character showed the display of Croatian wrath and they proved that they cannot be written off so easily an exciting match it is.... 

Spain literally struggled the start of the tournament everyone was a critique of Spain and Enrique the coach who always keep the winning personality everyone said that Spain was suffering because Enrique ruled out Ramos from the squad but what Spain really missed was the midfield duo of Busquets and Pedri.... what a performance by the 18 yrs old clearly taking every chance that he was getting... runs made by Azpiliqueta proved to be fatal for Croatian defence..... Busquets really dominated the midfield help in building up of attack by sudden through passes chased by Morata, Torres... but the super sub of Croatia Pasalic was the turning point of the match..... Croatia tried but came up little short before the dominating midfield of Spain.... A lots and lots of Drama on the pitch really an exciting match....",2021-06-29 08:56:10

 It is based on Elo rating. I used all 42365 ever played international matches. ([Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017)). I optimized the parameters of the Elo rating to give the best predictions. Using these Elo rating I can calculate the probability for each match. In the Euro 2020 there are 15 matches in the knockout phase, resulting in 2\^15=32768 scenario's. Each scenario has a probability. For each team I summed the probabilities of the scenario's that they reach a certain round. (6 matches have been played, winners are 100% certain for those matches)",2021-06-29 08:19:40

I was wondering if Anyone could help me out in trying to understand the current travel rules. 

So flights from Dublin to London are so much cheaper than flying belfast to London but I can't quite figure out what the regulations are.

it says you don't need to quarantine on the way to Britain just on the way back but on the [GOV.UK](https://GOV.UK) site it says ""Travellers whose journey originates in Northern Ireland are outside the scope of quarantine schemes, unless they have been overseas during the 14 days prior to their arrival in Ireland""

England and France squad depth,5,o9jt9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/o9jt9f/england_and_france_squad_depth/,25,1624885353.0,"I really don't know much about football and I'm trying to learn, the Euro helps a lot but so far it felt like England's play style is closer to a smaller nation (no offense intended) as in everyone is defending for the vast majority of the game. On the other hand you have France or Portugal yesterday where there's a lot more going on offensively.

Yet when you go online a lot of pundits say that England's pool of talent is similar to France's and the issue is the manager, is this true or is it a bias because we're mainly ready/watching stuff in English?",2021-06-28 16:02:33

I'm sick of seeing fans in the crowd. Literally no one in the history of football has turned on their TV just so they can see what a person watching a football match looks like.

To make it worse, these are often shown instead of replays. For example, Ronaldo's first free kick last night. After he took it, we got a shot of three Portuguese fans instead of a replay of what just happened. We had to wait five minutes for an actual replay.

And when there are VAR checks, all we see is the same crap no one cares about. The referee walking around. The players walking around. The crowd sitting around. Why don't we see what they're checking? In rugby you seem to get to see exactly what the TMO is looking at - why not do the same here?

Maybe it was always like this, but it seems especially frustrating in this tournament.",2021-06-28 15:55:17

It is based on Elo rating. I used all 42363 ever played international matches. ([Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017)). I optimized the parameters of the Elo rating to give the best predictions. Using these Elo rating I can calculate the probability for each match. In the Euro 2020 there are 15 matches in the knockout phase, resulting in 2\^15=32768 scenario's. Each scenario has a probability. For each team I summed the probabilities of the scenario's that they reach a certain round. (4 matches have been played, winners are 100% certain for those matches)",2021-06-28 08:33:43

Euro 1996 - overrated (by the English media),5,o94kz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/o94kz2/euro_1996_overrated_by_the_english_media/,5,1624824522.0,"Before I start, it might be worth pointing out that yes, I am English.

I know we have to put up with the media circus every time a tournament comes round, but it feels even more full on this year.

Why do the English press overhype our Euro 1996 campaign?

We only won two games (in 90 minutes), didn’t even make the final despite having home advantage yet we have it rammed down our throats as if we won the damn thing!

A week ago there was even a Euro 96 programme on TV where Shearer, Lineker and Richards gave their top 10 moments from it... despite it not really being a stand out tournament (IMO) in recent years?

Don’t get me wrong, it was probably the last time I really liked an England team. Awesome weather (for once), all the games on TV, genuine hope. I still remember walking home as a 12 year old whilst 3-1 up against the Dutch, getting to the end of my road only to hear what felt like every house erupting in noise as we scored our 4th.

But does the obsession about a tournament we didn’t win, or even get to the final of, seem a little weird?",2021-06-27 23:08:42

I'm curious who your favorite ESPN commentator team is. Thus far I've absolutely loved Derek Rae and Efan Ekoku. I have to say Ekoku is probably my favorite. He and Rae make a great team. 

I've been more or less impressed with the commentary, but Taylor Twellman continues to be my least favorite commentator--ever, probably. He's extremely obnoxious. Jimmy Conrad would be a solid replacement if they wanted to keep the American angle on the network.

Thoughts?

I’m really interested in the phenomenon (and the unwritten rules) of throwing your beer when your team scores a goal.

* What games have you ever thrown beer for?
* If you don’t like it, why don’t you?
* Is it a full beer which you throw?
* Have you ever regretted it afterwards?
* How much money have you spent doing it?
* Do you throw the plastic cup and the beer, or just the beer?
* Have you ever thrown beer for a goal which has been disallowed?
* Is it just an English thing, or do other countries do it? I think I've seen Danish fans do it a lot? 
* When did it start in a football context?",2021-06-27 11:10:12

* Also, Scotland's last 5 EURO goalscorer's name starts with 'Mc'
* Goran Pandev is now the 2nd oldest goalscorer at EUROs behind Vastic
* Kacper Kozlowski is the youngest ever player to play at the EUROs (this record was actually broken twice as firstly it was taken by Jude Bellingham)

The Dutch always seem to get slept on. They do always seem to under perform when they're hyped, so maybe it's a good thing. But do the majority of viewers not see them as a top team? I'm genuinely confused. Realistically, what are their odds of winning it, and why? I find them to be by far the most entertaining team to watch. Maybe that's all I need.",2021-06-24 10:08:18

Given that VAR hasn’t tempered arguments about whether a foul is deserving of a penalty, and that penalties often make or break a game, have alternatives been considered in the past? Something that would be 50/50 odds rather than 75/25?

Euro 2020 is fixed. Here is why,0,o619fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/o619fx/euro_2020_is_fixed_here_is_why/,11,1624407908.0,"Euro 2020 is fixed and I believe I have solid evidence to suggest that. My brother is a doctor in Turkey (Başkent Hospital) and his colleague is the head doctor for the Turkish National Football team. On June 13 (after Turkeys first loss against Italy) I called my brother to ask him about what he thought about the game and what he thinks our chances of qualifying to the round of 16 are. He said not likely. When I asked him why, he said that his colleague and the medical staff of the national team are due to return to Turkey on June 24. Why would the medical staff be sent home when the team still had a mathematical chance of qualifying? As you all know, Turkey is not one of the 11 host nations in the tournament. Now, why on earth would the Turkish football federation send the medical staff back home before knowing whether the team qualified or not? Especially when we saw the importance of medical staff in the Denmark v Finland game when Eriksen collapsed all of a sudden. I am convinced that the Turkish football federation knew for a fact that Turkey wouldn't qualify; therefore, they decided to send them back home. I know this is a conspiracy theory; however, considering that UEFA is corrupt I wouldn't put it through them. 

Ps: I know I should've posted this as soon as my brother told me but I didn't quite know how to express myself.",2021-06-23 03:25:08

More than 60,000 fans will be allowed into Wembley for the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 after a deal was struck between the UK government and Uefa.

The biggest crowds at a British sporting event for 15 months are now in prospect, although details of who will be able to attend the matches, and how, remain unresolved.

Wembley is to be allowed to open up to 75% of its 90,000 capacity for the three games, due to be played on 7, 8 and 11 July, respectively. It means there will be at least 35,000 extra tickets made available for the climax of the tournament. The government says they expect that priority of access will be given to UK residents who lost their tickets when capacity was first cut due to the pandemic.",2021-06-22 19:06:47

In my mind say if England lose 2-0 that will keep them on 4 points and they're goal difference will go down to minus 1.

And then if Croatia beat Scotland 2-0 that would give them 4 points and a goal difference of +1?

So surely that would put Croatia in 2nd place? Or am I missing something lol

I recently read that the Wembley capacity for SF and Final has been increased to 50% of stadium capacity (it was 25% so far), which means an extra 22,500 seats made available for the final stages. There's also the rumoured opportunity that the semi-finals and final could be moved altogether from Wembley to Budapest, where they could be hosted at 100% stadium capacity (67K people).

Both of  these scenarios should mean that there would be new tickets made available to the public, right? Unless I'm missing something.

Any advice for fully vaccinated travelers from Canada?,2,o49ssp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/o49ssp/any_advice_for_fully_vaccinated_travelers_from/,4,1624207836.0," 

Hey everyone,

I have 2 tickets to the QF in Rome on July 3rd that will be the winner of Group B (Belgium) and 2nd place in Group F (Germany/France/Portugal).

I live in Canadas and am fully vaccinated. Has anyone been able to figure out how easy/hard it will be to move between countries? I really don't want to be turned back or denied entry into Rome.

Right now there's a 10 day quarantine in Italy from anyone coming from Canada (no information about exemptions for fully vaccinated individuals).

In lieu of that, I'm looking at entering from France since Canada is on France's green list and France is on Italy's green list... so I'm thinking Canada -> Paris -> Rome.

Anyone else have experience trying to plan travel around this? I'm also open to selling the 2 tickets (Category 2) if it's not feasible... just DM me if you're interested. I have them in the app!",2021-06-20 19:50:36
Chance of Switzerland and Wales being completely tied in Group A?,4,o49ei1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/o49ei1/chance_of_switzerland_and_wales_being_completely/,12,1624206664.0,"If two teams are equal on points at the end of the 3 group games, there are a couple other factors used to determine who comes out on top. In order, these are: head to head, goal difference, goals for, most wins, discipline. If this is still not enough, and the 2 teams are playing in the final game, then a penalty shootout will be used, however this will not be the case for Wales and Switzerland.

If I've added it up correctly, a 3-0 win loss for Wales and 2-0 win for Switzerland in their final games would mean they both have 4 points, a draw between the 2 sides, -1 goal difference, 3 goals scored and 1 win. Going into the final game, Switzerland have 4 yellows vs Wales' 3 yellows, meaning if all of the above happened and Wales had 1 more yellow than Switzerland, then they would be completely tied.

Of course it's unlikely this exact scenario plays out, but it's not impossible, so are there any other deciders in place to prevent an extra tie-break game being played?

&#x200B;

Edit: Ok I've found the answer to my own question. They would then refer to the overall European Qualifier Rankings, where Switzerland would triumph with 9th place versus Wales' 19th place. Certainly would be a cruel way to miss out on 2nd place.",2021-06-20 19:31:04

Claiming that UEFA is only doing it for the money.It seems people just love hating on UEFA, which is justified a lot of the time. But even if it's the main driving factor behind changing the final venue, I really can't see a problem with it in this case.

Thousands of more fans would be able to attend a Puskas Arena final compared to one played at Wembley. It's the only stadium with full stadium capacity. Not only would way more people get to enjoy it live, it would also create a much better atmosphere that a Euro final deserves.",2021-06-20 03:03:26

WTH is the point of VAR if referees can still make bullshit calls or decide when to use it?,4,o36b68,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/o36b68/wth_is_the_point_of_var_if_referees_can_still/,10,1624070326.0,"Wasn't the whole point of VAR to avoid referee errors (or even quash concerns of match-fixing)? If that's the case, why does the sole decision on whether or not to use VAR fall on the referee? It makes no sense. 

Referees aren't blind and they always had a good view of what happened on the pitch, even before VAR. Sometimes they would consult with the linesmen if they weren't sure. The majority of poor refereeing decisions were made due to either incompetence or sheer favouritism. VAR hasn't solved this at all. Sometimes there's a clear case for a review with players screaming for a review and the referee will simply decide not to check it. Of course, they always end up checking if it's going to benefit France or another big tram (such as in the final of World Cup). 

The calls in the Croatia vs Czech game were even worse. They used VAR to closely examine something that wasn't a penalty and still awarded one anyway. Then, the referee blows the full time whistle 20 seconds early while Croatia were literally in the middle of an attack and had the ball in the box. That's just clear bias. Neutral referees will usually let the game go on for up to a minute past the allocated injury time if another team is building an attack. To blow 20 seconds early in the middle of an attack while a team is chasing a goal is ridiculous.

Slovakia also had a blatant penalty denied in the last minute after 2 handballs by Swedish players. 2 defenders literally punched the ball to each other in the box and nothing, the referee chose not to review. 

Shouldn't it work like in tennis where a team can actually request a review themselves?",2021-06-19 05:38:46

Why Denmark's Euro hopes are far from dead,25,o2m1op,https://www.reddit.com/r/Euro2020/comments/o2m1op/why_denmarks_euro_hopes_are_far_from_dead/,8,1624012416.0,"**Tl;dr if Belgium beat Finland without Finland scoring and Denmark beats Russia, Denmark are guaranteed to finish as runner-ups in the group.**

We all remember what happened in Denmark's match against Finland. A controversial match that shouldn't have been resumed so soon after, according to most people, especially since they were given an ultimatum by UEFA. Denmark walked away with zero points in that match, but the fact that Christian Eriksen survived is an infinitely bigger victory.

Denmark started off fantastically against Belgium, obtaining the lead in the second minute and pretty much dominated the entire first half. But in the second half, masterclass Belgium and Kevin de Bruyne turned it around and won 2-1. Heartbreaking for Denmark, who played really well.

Denmark face Russia in Copenhagen in their final group match and need to win to advance to the knockout phase. Should Denmark win 1-0, they will have the same amount of points as Russia and Finland. For arguments sake, let's also say Belgium beats Finland 1-0 (but a higher win margin is likely). The tiebreaker criteria(s) in **bold** would be applied:

1. Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;
2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;
3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;
4. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who are still level to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 10 apply;
5. **Superior goal difference in all group matches**;
6. **Higher number of goals scored in all group matches**;
7. Higher number of wins in all group matches;
8. If on the last round of the group stage, two teams are facing each other and each has the same number of points, as well as the same number of goals scored and conceded, and the score finishes level in their match, their ranking is determined by a penalty shoot-out. (This criterion is not used if more than two teams have the same number of points.);
9. Lower disciplinary points total in all group matches (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card, 4 points for a yellow card followed by a direct red card);
10. Higher position in the European Qualifiers overall ranking.

&#x200B;

Group B would like like this in this scenario:

1. Belgium: 9 pts. 6-1 (+5).
2. Denmark: 3 pts. 2-3 (-1).
3. Finland: 3 pts. 1-2 (-1).
4. Russia: 3 pts. 1-4 (-3).",2021-06-18 13:33:36

I was watching a man city game last season and saw Phil Foden being very sturdy in the penalty box trying to make a play get a ball in front of goal.

Comment,5,h6klhlh,,0,1627295164.0,I think Sterling is a big problem because diving is such a big part of his game. He gets rewarded cheap frees and penalties and other players copy him.He is fast but his first touch is awful. But the referees and VAR also have to take the blame. Take Sterlings dive against Denmark. The referees need to show some balls and not give these types of penalties because it's only going to encourage more diving. Likewise Mbappe's penalty vs Hungary shouldn't have been given either. The referees have to be strong in these situations. Like the Dutch referee in the final. He wasn't interested in Sterlings antics,2021-07-26 13:26:04

Comment,3,h6kexu8,,0,1627289173.0,"stop pretending English players are holier than thou and this is something new that English players have never ever done before..they dive just as much as anyone else except its not made a big deal of when its team England doing the diving... pretty sure l saw at least two blatant dives from English players this Euro... when a player from another country does it the local media love to highlight it but if its a home player then its not such a big deal. The same goes for bad fan behaviour... English media go mental when they see fans from another country play up but when its English fans its just chalked up as a tiny small minority... never mind that English football fans have a world wide long standing reputation for getting ridiculously drunk, turning violent and vandalising whatever city they may be in including their own.",2021-07-26 11:46:13

Is this the dive you're talking about? 
Went down easy but hardly means England were diving to try succeed. England and every other team have always had players that have gone down easily or dived.

That's 1 minutes worth of the Italian people being racist by your logic. All racism should be condemned and I dont think the lack of POC in the italian side is racist for the record. I also wouldn't present racist Italian journalism with an aim of excusing any English racist journalism (as you pointed out you belive the subject to be reverse-racism) I'd just choose to go with a message without your tabloid-like targeted bitching if you care to be taken seriously. 

If you don't care, cool, carry on.",2021-07-19 22:19:50

Comment,25,h5sb20n,,0,1626721753.0,"The English media are a complete and utter disgrace. This is such bullshit journalism. The English medias knowledge of the Italian national team and Seria A is piss poor. The best 26 players for each national team should be chosen. It doesn't matter about skin colour. Sure in a year or two a world class black or coloured Italian player(s) could break into the national team. The Economist knows Jack shit about Italian football. They are just sore losers playing the race card. When it was the English fans giving racist abuse to their own players. 

I also seen an article in the English newspaper the Guardian that said that deciding a match on penalties is too outdated and should be scraped. Would they have said this if England won the shootout? Absolutely not, This is another example of the English media being sore losers. Just because they've lost a couple of penalty shootouts throughout the years, they now want them scrapped. The bottom line is England had 120mins to win that game. They simply weren't good enough. Apart from Luke Shaws goal they didn't have a shot on target and that says it all. Italy dominated and thoroughly deserved the win",2021-07-19 22:09:13

And again, if you really want to compare nations you should simply analize the composition of the global population of each nation...

What is the % of coloured people in UK out the global population of that country? What is that % in Italy? Without a serious and number-based analize you are simply say NOTHING. This is supposed to be a ""tecnical"" newpaper, and this is kinda gossip....

Simply writing such an article is just a shamefull try to put some kind of shit over a team.....

Of course they had/have some children of immigrant families but the number is not as high as in Germany/France/England.

Transition between old and modern football and obviously won by my country. I'm 23 and I remember 2004 as well. Not that good. 2012 was a modern one, didn't like it that much, national football teams did worse and there were less iconic players or about to retire, for example Pirlo. 2016 was surprising but did not have the mystery of 2020 and 2020 has been the revelation of football, the confirmation that some leagues are stronger than we thought, that some teams have resuscitated and that everyone can win as football is getting physically tougher and more technical. Great old national teams are starting to be again great and there were many underdogs who performed really well such as Denmark or Osterreich. But yes, that 2008... Robben, Van Der Sar, Arshavin, Spanish National team, Ballack, Schweinsteiger, Lahm, Kahveçi, prime Torres, young Ibrahimovic, Di Natale, Grosso... Wow.",2021-07-18 15:07:24

Comment,3,h5gsk3o,,0,1626484072.0,"its just the phrase ""its coming home"" which is seen by many as a little arrogant, like football is ours, we invented it and the trophy will be coming home to us because we invented the entire sport....l know that England has given a lot to the world but l don't think football was solely an English invention... for me the seed of football came to Britain with the Romans through a game called Harpastum, an ancient game played with a ball on a field with a line in the centre and two goals either end, two teams one on either side of the line, the objective of this game was to get the ball into the opposing players net... sounds remarkably like modern football to me, obviously over the centuries the original game has evolved into what it is today but l find it hard to believe people cant accept the fact that it was initiated in Britain through the Romans, the Romans did not invent the game they adapted it from a similar Greek game, but the modern games inception in England must of been through the Roman game of Harpastrum its just logical, we know the Romans founded London (Londra) and were in Britain for a long time so it just makes sense, sure the English can take credit for association football but not for inventing the game.",2021-07-17 04:07:52
Comment,1,h5gsc25,,0,1626483950.0,"Is saying Pickford looks like a little bitch human decency to you? Players quarrel and complain and communicate all the time, and as a goalkeeper this is even more commonplace. But yeah insult someone’s appearance when you don’t watch football and don’t know how players conduct themselves. Real decency there. 

The main point you made is that it’s sad that basic human decency is the bar for fans. What’s the problem with that? Whether you like it or not, sport is a major part of people’s lives, and fans of a losing team are never going to be expected to kiss hug and congratulate the victors. It’s clear you don’t understand how emotionally invested many hundreds of millions of people are in sport.

Pickford looks like a little bitch when he shouts to his colleagues (also blaming them when they did perfectly fine, at least 3 times in this very match), when he complains to the referee and even when he complains by himself.   
Some people understood (like the dude with the funny comparison to King Joffrey), some didn't. You clearly didn't, no shame on that ;)  


Tbh you just seem to be making an effort to not understand.  
If you think that a professional's international results don't matter much to their career... well... suit yourself. If they won they'd split about 10 million, but much more important than that, their careers would get a massive boost. But yeah, they only play because they are patriots.

I'm glad to see the UK is looking to give permanent live match bans to anyone who sends racial abuse on the internet. Currently it only applies to those caught doing it in the stadium. Obviously sending racist abuse on the internet has been illegal for a long time, but banning those individuals from attending matches isn't currently in the punishment guidelines, so hopefully that changes soon. The outrage in England over the racism our superb players have received is very strong and has been front page news all week. Four people have currently been arrested.

I'm not trying to deny there is a problem here, just that A) players diving is normal and no country is innocent and it's just part of the game, and B) don't let moronic football fans affect how you feel about a whole nation of people. Hungary are in trouble for racism this tournament and I think have to play their next three games without fans, but I've been to Budapest and met Hungarians and they're absolutely lovely.

I'm more than certain fan behavior would improve immensely if they thought there was a chance their team would be eliminated from the competition if this sort of behavior occurred.

Lashing out at the anti-English morons on this sub by calling names back just puts you at their level and as a fellow English person I want to have your back and raise you up higher than that.",2021-07-16 02:43:27

Comment,2,h5c0hv3,,0,1626390544.0,"You must be new to football. Players dive all the time. Get over it. It's part of the game. Even a Danish player (who seem to have been evangelised during this tournament due to them having a fairytale story) was given a yellow card for diving in the box, and let's not forget Immobile's miraculous recovery. To anyone who knows football it is par for the course. I'm not saying it should be that way, but that is just how it is.

I've been watching football for 30 years and every nation has its problems with racism and violence. Sadly, football just seems to attract the worst people. It has influenced my opinion of other countries and their general population approximately 0%. Stop living in a bubble of sensationalist news and go out there and meet people.",2021-07-16 02:09:04

Comment,1,h5bw4xb,,0,1626388406.0,"lm not sure what you mean by shitty people being gravitated towards football? l mean you had the Royals in attendance and they appeared to be enjoying the match... until Italy won, are they shitty people? l think football attracts all kinds of people but in England for some reason there appears to be a large group of trouble makers who for whatever reason go way too far, ie booing national anthems, extreme violence, racial abuse, vandalism, l mean l could go on... l know it does not only happen in England but it is very strong and persistent there, its to the point and has been for years that other nations and cities dread hosting the English in these types of tournaments because they know there will be trouble, l know there are plenty of decent people in England who just want to enjoy the games and wont become enraged when their team loses, l watched the Euros here in Australia with a bunch of English people and it was very civilised. At the end of the day its only a game and it really shouldn't mean so much lm not sure what the answer is either but l would imagine if national teams can be banned from tournaments if this sort of behaviour from fans goes on then l think that might have some impact on controlling behaviour of unruly fans, bit unfair on players but extreme measures might be the only solution.

I can't pretend to understand what they go through, especially at such young age. Imagine losing a loved one and then immediately having to make a rational decision. Without delving into it on a psychological level, fame and fortune also comes at an equally hefty price. People moan about their salaries and most of them are excessive but personally I'd want that kind of money to try and cope with all the bad things they have to deal with.  With mental health at the forefront of well-being these days you'd hope the clubs will also be spending a good amount of time and money preparing them for this kind of life. Southgate definitely seems a good manager for that aspect of the job, as for the rest of the job I can't comment. Not all are ready for it or ever will be. I'm sure even Ronaldo has had days when his shoulders felt heavy but he puts on a good show. Some people are just narcissists and couldn't care less. Opinions will always be divided but luckily the majority of the nation are behind them even if it's in a misguided way like attacking the opposition.

Comment,1,h59oqnj,,0,1626352968.0,"Most of them (in big clubs) are dismantled or disallowed to enter the stadiums and everybody knows they meet each other to fight 'just for fun', to 'punch other countries' supporters' or 'fight the police'. I respect every single team and national team, but in Spain there was a lot of trouble with Galatasaray ultras (ultras, not fans), and with Legia Warszawa ultras that even punched some policemen and civil people. In a lot of Europa League matches, Spanish streets -and I think it is in every city they go-, Polish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian (...) ultras destroy everything and gather to 'demonstrate' who is stronger, a practise that makes no sense at all, at least for normal people. In July, Polish and Spanish people fighted in Sevilla, English people looked for Danish people to punch them, Boixos destroyed stadiums, Ultras Sur were linked to nazi people, Lazio ultras did not want black players -some of them, not all- and were linked to fascism... 

&#x200B;

When football becomes polytics -this is, when football gets violent and country vs. country, not team vs. team-, it stops being football and starts being animals cheering, fighting and growling that barely know what sport is about and only signal the player that missed the penalty -even if he did well in the match- or the manager that did not win the match even when that was the FIRST time ever they were in an Euro final. Atleti's ultras were, too, linked to Real Madrid's ultras, there was one person dead years ago because Deportivo de la Coruña fans and Atleti fans fighted and fell off a river. Some UCL ago, Moscow fans searched and fought the police and the Atleti ultras because they had searched each other in Facebook, some referees in Spain were about to die... And you know what? Only the teams that DO NOT have ultras (as Levante UD, or Villarreal...) here, for example, are the ones who have never had any problem, any violence, any intervention of the police... Valencia CF has fans and... surprise, they are linked to nazi people, there are always problems with them, they are isolated in a curve of the stadium (Curva Nord - North Curve) and almost fighted against me because I wore a Real Madrid shirt in a match. Never happened with Levante UD fans, even I could sit with them and talk about the chances missed. 

&#x200B;

I repeat myself again: hooligan-ultra movements (there are almost no differences at all nowadays) are not football. Do not represent football. Are violence, polytics and ignorance. Let people say what they want, but these are FACTS. Great supporters are not ultras, they are FANS. This is a lifestyle not others' life.",2021-07-15 15:42:48

Let’s not confuse things: these players are adults and professionals. You cannot excuse such behaviors because of fear of somebody’s else’s reaction.

They should be the example, the role models to the people that look up to them. They represent their nation. What they did just demonstrate that they are nor better or worse than their supporters.",2021-07-15 15:19:03

Comment,5,h59k2xi,,0,1626350121.0,"'The involved people were not English'.

'The accounts were not English'.

'The fans were not English'.

'They were Spanish, Italian and Eastern European fans pretending to be English people'.

'Fake accounts'.

'There must be a rematch'.

And so on...

&#x200B;

Maybe (partially, of course) they were actually English. Or did I watch and read the wrong news, such as this one? Is UEFA wrong, too?

&#x200B;

Let's see what UEFA decides -I don't think anything special will happen, tho-. A bunch -but still a minority, let's remark that, too-, of d\*mb people have harmed the innocent one who went only to cheer, to watch the spectacle and to have fun. Let's not generalize and say 'all English people are the same', because that is not true and there is a lot of great people in there and who went to have fun in family, in friends, alone... whatever. I'm Spanish and even I don't think they should be taken as 'all the same', but... Let's say that these ENGLISH fans, a minority of them, but ENGLISH, were not too sane. 

In short: what football should be about, not punching people from Denmark, destroying gates, illegally entering the stadium or destroying foreign cities. Just enjoying 'ball. Let's signal that so it never repeats again. Fans: nice. Violent hooligans or ultras: not nice.

Cheers and ENJOY football.",2021-07-15 14:55:21
Comment,2,h59k16p,,0,1626350090.0,"I think it was a big mistake by England. I think England's central midfield is weak. I mean Rice and Philips were exposed at this level. England have some really good attacking players like Kane, Rashford, and Sancho but they were very isolated. England were too reliant on Shaw and Trippier to create things. I think England are missing a creative centre midfield that can get on the ball and create things. Maybe in two or three years time they'll have that player. I think southgate messed up his subs though. Rashford and Sancho should have been on way earlier. How could he expect them to take winning penalties when they've hardly played in the tournament and are not even warmed up. How are they meant to feel like part of the team. This is where Mancini was wise. The majority of his squad played a big part at various stages of the tournament",2021-07-15 14:54:50

Personally, I think the best you can do as a kicker is decide how and where you want to kick before starting the run, than stick to the plan no matter what.
I saw many penalties going wrong due to kicker's last second doubts/rethinking.

Comment,2,h5942c4,,0,1626336924.0,"The other team also gets rid of a player of their choice. So there is no ""running out of players"", but they still gain an advantage by eliminating their weakest penalty taker. Without this rule, the red-carded team would have the advantage:

""Only players who were on the pitch at the end of play will be allowed to participate in the shoot-out. If one side has more players on the pitch than the other, whether as a result of injury or red cards, then the side with more players must select some players who will not take part. For example, if Team A has 11 players but Team B only has 10, then Team A will choose one player who will not take part. Players chosen this way cannot play any part in the procedure, including acting as goalkeeper. The rule was introduced by the International Football Association Board in February 2000 because previously an eleventh kick would be taken by the eleventh (i.e. weakest) player of a full-strength team and the first (i.e. strongest) player of a sub-strength team. A rule change in 2016 eliminated the potential for a team to gain such an advantage if a player is injured or sent off during the shoot-out.""

Comment,2,h572dlp,,0,1626294872.0,"I think england has lost its culture in the last couple of decades, a large percentage of young people in britain are very focused around talking like ""gangsters"" and appearing as visibly tough and intimidating as possible. I mean, all I need to do is look out of my window and I see the kids walking around with full tracksuits, and those little handbags that look like they are carrying drugs, again, trying to appear as tough and as cool as possible. Treating everyone like shit, vandalising and so on.

I was born in england, grew up here, however I am also half german and 100% of the time, always fully support germany in any situation where it is germany vs england... because of the above. Particularly in secondary school, the amount of comments I would get about being a ""nazi"" simply for being half german was sad.

I've been to Europe many times, and I have also lived in Germany for some time... and I feel like overall people are just a lot more sophisticated in mainland Europe when compared to the UK. Better morals, culture, family life etc. Of course, this is a generalisation - but percentage wise it is definitely true.

You could even hear the english crowd singing about the war during the germany v england game (get over it? :D). But also booing every single other national anthem etc. It's just a country that is 50% trash.

Comment,1,h55xd5y,,0,1626276839.0,"When I saw it live the first thing I thought was that he was going to miss. The way he ran, the way he was positioned and also Donnarumma trying to show that all the goal was covered made him try to adjust a ball where Donnarumma could not probably arrive, to play safe (but taking risks) and doing something similar as Jorginho in the last penalty Vs our country, Spain. He almost did it but too much rotation was made, too much hip power was given. It was not psychological or not a half part, like Saka, tho. It was the attempt to kick an accurate penalty with a not that fair technique (not like Jorginho Vs. Spain, and I say Spain, because Jorginho missed too against England) and in one of the most difficult zones of the goal in football. Do you want to see the same penalty in the same conditions in also a final? Look at Juanfran's last penalty in the 11th Champions League of Real Madrid in 2016. Shoot, pressure, keeper was always diving, he wanted to put it where the keeper couldn't reach and then boom, straight to the post. Same.

I personally wouldn't care if the opposition booed the English national anthem and would just see it as banter, but if it does genuinely offend other nations then that should be respected. I think most English people don't really feel a strong connection to their national anthem as it's laughably outdated and dreary, and seems to be just about the Queen who is seen as a sort of quirky novelty of the British state with no real purpose in government anymore. I personally wouldn't boo any anthem anyway as I quite like listening to them and I find booing a bit unimaginative if you get what I mean. I would say though, don't interpret the booing as an actual critique of your country, it's just moronic fans trying to goad the other side. I'm sure those people go on holiday to wherever it is you live and have a great time and enjoy what it has to offer. 

The setup for this Euro has been a bit weird as normally there would be way more fans from other sides attending, but Covid has made that difficult.

Comment,4,h55530g,,0,1626261647.0,"Well.
Penalties are practised in the training sessions but there is no list of penalty takers in any match. That's because you don't know if someone's going to be injured, or substituted or not so confident.
Players do have a choice, but the last one's comes from the manager. Players usually assume the responsibility of taking a penalty and say ""I take this"". Others say ""not me"". Manager takes that into account so as to change the list. Maybe he thinks the player will be ready to kick a penalty or he was the best penalty taker in the training sessions but suddenly he psychologically thinks he's not prepared and decides not to take a penalty that probably he is not sure he will score. Pressure is the main subject here.
Then, a player who has been substituted can never enter the game again. That is the reason why Southgate made the substitutions in the 118th minute retiring a player who had entered less than one hour ago (Jordan Henderson). Personally, I wouldn't had changed Henderson. But no, the answer is no. Only the players in the field can take them. If they go to more than ten penalties, then, the goalkeepers must shoot the 11th. That happened in the final of the UEFA Europa League between Manchester United and Villarreal. In the 11th penalty, Rulli, the Villarreal's goalkeeper scored while De Gea (Manchester's goalkeeper) missed.
Then, fourth, normally a keeper saves from 20 to 30% of the penalties at best. It is about guessing by the position of the body, the way of running of the kicker and their hips where are going to put the ball in. A good penalty kicker should have the ability to run towards one direction and pull his hips in the opposite direction than the kicking leg. Look at Cristiano Ronaldo (80% or more of success) and look how bad Belotti kicked his. Everyone knew where was the penalty going. 

And about Saka... Probably some players were not feeling like taking penalties and Southgate thought that Saka was a great penalty taker. In training sessions there is no pressure and you can perform very well. But when in pressure, the keeper fails, everyone commits mistakes and experience is the key. Experienced players who have gone through this matches and penalty shootouts are very used to them. So, probably the best takers were psychologically unable to take them or not confident, Saka took the leadership, but not enough experience, the responsibility of keeping your country In the battle to win their first Euro or get kicked off, the whole stadium looking at you and an experienced young (21yo) keeper that is roughly 6'6"" looking at you, took him off. It is 50/50 so both things could have happened. Rashford same. He was not nervous but wanted to assure by putting it the closest possible to the post, far away from Donnarumma. It turned to be too far. Also he ran oddly, it is easier for a goalkeeper to guess where you will shoot if your hips unveil it.

Cheers from Spain (eliminated by Italy and one of the biggest rivals historically of England). Congrats for that second place.

Comment,8,h553miw,,0,1626260510.0,"Players can only take penalties if they are on the pitch by full time. Anyone on the bench cannot take a penalty.
It depends on the player but generally you can assume a player would be better at taking a penalty if they had had the chance to warm up an be involved in the game first, but thats not why they were subbed on. They were subbed on as they needed to be on the pitch by full time. Had the ball not gone out of play to allow the substitutions, they would not have been able to take a penalty.

The likely reason the substitutions were made so late was because to bring on a good penalty taker would mean bringing off a bad penalty taker. In this case, this meant taking a defender off for a striker and leaving the defence vulnerable. Therefore making this change late allows the opponent less time to take advantage of the striker playing out of position in defence.

It's a gamble in any case. On this occasion it didn't pay off.",2021-07-14 14:01:50

Comment,18,h54ycwr,,0,1626255968.0,"1. Depends on the manager. Some will have a set list of takers before the game, some will see who is up for it and ask for volunteers before the shoot out. Sometimes a mix between the two. 
2. A player can tell a manager they aren’t feeling confident and defer their penalty to later down the line in the hope it doesn’t get to them. But if scores remain level eventually everyone will have to take one. Goalkeepers included. 
3. No
4. The odds are in the takers favour, hence most penalties are scored. Keepers tend to be in a win win situation with a shootout. Save some and you are the hero, if you don’t then there isn’t really that expectation. Obviously if a keeper is getting a hand to shots without saving them then questions start getting asked. 

1. That’s the question a lot of people are asking. Southgate took the blame saying those were our top 5 takers from practice, but that may be him trying to take responsibility from the lad. Personally I think there were a few better choices.",2021-07-14 12:46:08

Comment,1,h54sswy,,0,1626250748.0,"I saw you posted another comment saying you don’t watch football, and also thought Pickford shouting at his players was him complaining/blaming them, when in fact he is just communicating with them. Sport since the beginning of its inception, to the Olympics, to the Mayans, to now, has been, and will continue to be a central part of billions of lives, whether fans get material gains/losses from it or not. If you do not understand that, you don’t understand sport. Additionally as I’ll say again, fans leaving the stadium early has been common forever, and is not an issue for any player/fan/organization. This is a non-issue, and while English fans are due much criticism, this is not something to be criticized for, and is extremely trivial.

And again, as I’ll say, there were multiple reasons for fans leaving early aside from not wanting to prolong the pain of their side’s defeat. Isn’t that moral decency in and of itself; that fans in pain from defeat are allowed to leave early?

Edit: and the money professionals make in international football is like drops into a lake compared to their club careers, yet they all play with the same, if not more passion and immoral tendencies to gain advantages. Why? Because sport is a part of their lives. You can not reduce sport to something that only matters and can only be life changing when it involves material gain.",2021-07-14 11:19:08

xD  
I'm not ""new to football"", neither do I live out of contact with society, neither ""I'm new"" to the concept of sports or even practicing them at an amateur level xD

I kept making referrence to it but I guess it didn't stick: I am referring to fans, not to the professionals.   
The **professionals** are making a living with it, so I understand every time they try to cheat. I hope video reviews will be used to punish cheaters who get away with it, I hope fans would hold them accountable, etc.   
I also hope fans would understand a professional might go wherever he is best paid, because he is a professional and has his livelihood at stake.  
**Fans** are not making a living with it and they get nothing more than a vicarious kick or boost in their egos. They have the opportunity to very easily raise above basic human decency without losing anything; I don't understand how anybody could feel the need to argue that basic human decency should indeed be the bar even for people who have no real stakes on.

England has some hard questions to ask of ourselves, and we are, all the talk of the last few days has rightly focused on the abuse, and not unfortunately of the nearly excellent performance of England in the tournament. 

We've come a long way in recent years but have a lot of work to do to fully stamp out racism in the game, but we wil get there.

In any case, I don't think it is much important....I mean, It was really a mess, so guess not even easy to reach azzurri :):)

During the game I saw a couple of time italian players After their faults going to shake hand to english ones, refused by them.
Chiellini on Saka After the Yellow card, for example.

Comment,2,h533wbh,,0,1626213198.0,I'm not offended as I'm totally open to rational debate. I've pointed out already that it is a select portion of the population who have issue with the incident. The majority I'm sure don't and even more couldn't care less. You're not wrong in the way you think and the sport is ruined by a minority. I've already tried to change the title but I can't. I would remove the 'England fans' as in retrospect it does a appear as a sweeping statement and that wasn't my intention.,2021-07-14 00:53:18

Comment,1,h532mmd,,0,1626212600.0,"""The point is England fans accept the ref's decision for a penalty in the previous game as karma for the times they were wronged including bringing up Maradona's 'hand of God' from before most of them were even born. But this, in their opinion is totally unjust."" 

Your words. Generalising what 'England fans' think because they must all be the same. I'm sure some England fans do think that but don't tar us all with the same brush. The foundations of xenophobia are sweeping generalisations. Whilst your comment is a fairly tame insult and I'm sure it's just a case of poor phrasing that could've been avoiding by using the words 'some England fans accept...' it's just tiring reading all the hate on here. I've perhaps unjustly picked on your post as comparatively it's not so bad, but football is a sport cursed with vile ideology and we need to rise above it and set an example that all nations and people are equal.

I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you. In reflection I'm probably just blowing things out of proportion. You've not done anything bad. As I said, I'm just in despair at the way people have been treating each other all tournament.",2021-07-14 00:43:20

Comment,5,h530xb6,,0,1626211802.0,"I don't see that in the replay personally, I think Maguire knows full well he wasn't kicked in the face, but gladly accepts the free kick. In any event, the benefit of the doubt is never given in the same way to an Italian (or really any southern european/south american).

It was shameful to see Spinazolla boo'd after his achilles exploded, as well as Chiesa and another player I cant recall in the final, both of whom were injured. England put on an absolute dive clinic in the match, and had the gall to complain about the Italians. The clip is somehow not available to me anymore but there is one in which Kane and Phillips both roll around faking an injury in the same offensive action, until the ball comes near enough that they might be useful, when they hop right up.

Comment,4,h52tj6h,,0,1626208404.0,"I'm an England supporter and I approve of it lol. It's a professional foul and happens all the time. I'd be annoyed if England didn't do the same and allowed the other team to break away and score with little game time left to make an equaliser. He pulled his shirt and knew he'd get the yellow. It's a standard tactic as pulling shirts don't carry more than a yellow. It was perhaps a little high but whatever, no harm done. I'm positive Saka knows it was the right thing to do in the circumstances.

What is an offence though are low quality memes like this that do nothing but fuel the fire for racists and xenophobes to keep talking shit on the internet. Your answer to abuse is to stoke it further by lashing out and trying to antagonise those that need very little encouragement to continue being pricks.

Comment,1,h52ogua,,0,1626206142.0,"Exactly, even more because it was at the start, Italy really had the whole game to equalize. Ok, England lost, but it got second place, I don’t think you can say that’s bad results. This England has been one of the best in the last 20 years. And as well, penalty is at lot of luck, even more than skill. That’s why they use them as final tie breaker. Same. I watched 6 out of 7 game of Italy, last group one I didn’t care much since they were already qualified. And with England I think I missed a couple group games, and the one against Germany, but I did called England winner of that, so… 🤷🏻‍♂️
